		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When city zoning became formalized in North America during the first decades of the twentieth century, one of the first things many cities and suburbs began to regulate was the presence of livestock and farm animals.

While animals have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, aesthetic and health concerns accompanying industrialization caused cities to question the advantages of hosting certain types of animals.  Livestock had provided urban dwellers with important nutritional supplements but with industrialization, the argument went, people no longer had to rely on their own husbandry for protien.  They could simply buy their food in markets.

Recently, however, people are beginning to question the wisdom of these zoning codes--although, not without intense political argument.

The <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0608080200aug08,1,4804541.story?coll=chi-newslocal-hed">Chicago Tribune reports today</a> about a battle brewing in the exclusive suburb of Lake Forest pitting the ex-wife of the heir to the Walgreens drugstore chain against her neighbors.  Estelle Walgreen apparently is fond of pot-bellied pigs and keeps several as pets over the objection of her neighbors.  The article implies that Lake Forest has an ordinance prohibiting farm animals, but Walgreen did not feel that it applied to her pot-bellied since they are pets--not meat.  The city council did not buy her argument and has voted to have them removed.
<a href="http://www.evanstonnow.com/node/828" />

<a href="http://www.evanstonnow.com/node/828">Evanston is also in the midst of a controversy</a> on the appropriateness of beekeeping in the suburb.  In this case a teenager developed an interest in apiculture and installed a honeybee hive over neighbors' objections. The city has an ordinance relating to animals--but not insects.  After several weeks of debate, the city is still weighing its options.

Evanston may be more sympathetic to urban beekeeping as there has been a significant trend in recent years to encourage ecologically-friendly activities in urban and suburban settings and Evanston has recently adopted a <a href="http://www.cityofevanston.org/global/strat1.shtml">strategic plan that encompasses sustainability</a>.

The outcome of the bee controversy may be an indicator of the city's committment to sustainable policies.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Energy Policy and Alternative Fuels</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When President Bush asserted that the United States was "addicted to oil" in his most recent State of the Union speech, it took many by surprise.  Given the fact that he was a former oil company executive, had close ties to the energy industry, and essentially ignored energy policy during the first term of his presidency, it was notable that he would frame the policy issue in the lexicon of "addiciton"--a characterization more in line with environmental critics.

Today, the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115508989132030708.html?mod=hps_us_pageone">Wall Street Journal discusses</a> the status of Bush's energy policymaking more than 6 months later.  In the weeks after his State of the Union remarks, Bush trumpeted the possibility of the bio-fuel, ethanol, as being an alternative to oil.  The article does a good job dicussing the numerous challenges in such an approach: lagging distribution systems, and the relative poor efficiency of ethanol as compared to gasoline.  There are other challenges, as well, with ethanol, particularly the large governmental subsidies that currently go to agribusinesses that produce the base material for the fuel.

Similarly, there is a crucial contradiction relating to ethanol in our national energy policy: if it is such an attractive replacement, <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14185606/">why do we continue to levy tariffs on imports from our allies</a> and trading partners who want to export the fuel to the United States?

The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/us/09gas.html?ex=1312776000&en=c4bd5a20f77a8898&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">New York Times has a story today</a> on the social impact of current energy policies that serves as a good companion to the WSJ piece.  The article discusses how people are coping with rising gas prices.  Generally when prices rise for a good, it is expected that demand drops.  A poll conducted by the Pew Research Center indicated that people lower income groups have reported changing their behavior in the face of rising gas prices by carpooling, making fewer trips, taking public transit, etc..  But, overall, there has been a rise in consumption.

This suggests that individuals and businesses that are more prosperous may be in a better position to withstand price fluctuations.  It will be interesting to see how this progresses in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/08/AR2006080801127.html?nav=hcmoduletmv">wake of the closure of BP's Prudhoe Bay pipeline</a> which will decrease the amount of domestic oil produced in Alaska.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hazards of Cycling in London</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Having been to London a few times it doesn't strike me as surprising to know that the city isn't too conducive to cycling.   Narrow streets, lots of lorries, buses, and cars, and a paucity of bike lanes can make riding a bike seem hazardous.

Thus, it was interesting to see this video clip of a cyclist commuting down Upper Thames Street <a href="http://blogs.independent.co.uk/independent/2008/10/this-is-what-we.html">in the Cyclotherapy blog</a> at the Independent.  It shows how deficient the so-called "bike lane" is and illustrates the difficulties in adapting streets for multi-modal use.  The lane is extremely narrow and consistently violated by lorries.  Judging from the streetscape, it is difficult to conceive of other ways to accommodate cycling--aside from getting rid of motorized traffic!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Clean Water Act Ignored by Feds, States, and Polluters</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://is.gd/3e40r">New York Times published a devastating article today</a> on the erosion of enforcement of the Clean Water Act over the past few years.  The article discusses how pollution of water sources nationwide has increased while the federal EPA and many state agencies have done nothing to penalize violators.

Much of this has to do with the hostility to regulation that marked the Bush Administration's ideology and the fact that state and federal administrators do not have the budgets needed to adequately insure compliance with water safety legislation.

The phenomena is prevalent throughout the country, but the article discusses an interesting example in West Virginia where coal mining operations essentially pump sludge and other byproducts of mining into aquifers, thus polluting the groundwater.

Another problematic source for polluting stems from pesticide and fertilizer runoff in the big agricultural states of the Midwest.

Problems with water safety are scandalously under-reported, so it is good to see the Times spending resources to compile information (they have also compiled a database of violations available on <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/toxic-waters/polluters">their website</a>).

It also helps to show the integrated nature of environmental problems which needs to inform policy debates.  Coal not only is problematic from the standpoint of greenhouse gas emissions, but also can literally kill people through pollution of groundwater.   Assuming you can sequester CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants, the public health issues related to its mining still persist.   Furthermore, the fact that poor water quality stemming from industry's indiscretions hurt people's health should also be brought into current debates pertaining to health care and health insurance.  If water sources polluted by industry in particular locales results in higher negative health outcomes, don't the polluters bear some responsibility for bearing the costs of health care for its victims?

Similarly, the article discusses agriculture as a problematic source of water pollution.  This stems from monoculture production of commodity crops such as corn, soybeans, etc...These crops need toxic enhancements to grow which, in turn, contaminate groundwater.

The irony here is that polluting monocrop agriculture is highly subsidized.  The products--such as corn--are converted into such products as animal feed or high fructose corn syrup which contribute to the high carbon footprint of agriculture and health problems such as obesity.

Thus, the system that produces dirty water also produces dirty air and bad public health in a myriad of ways.

It is good to see the current EPA administrator express concern about the current situation.  Remedying these systemic problems will likely take a lot of time and resources.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Financing For Developing Countries Major Sticking Point for Climate Talks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/15/science/earth/15climate.html?em">New York Times has a nice article</a> explaining the persistent tension between the G-77 (and China) and the industrialized countries.  It basically comes down to money.

In UN parlance, this is concern over <a href="http://unfccc.int/ttclear/jsp/index.jsp"><em>technology transfer</em></a> and <a href="http://unfccc.int/adaptation/items/4159.php"><em>adaptation</em></a>.  The highest rates of growth for carbon usage are in developing countries; but these countries see this growth as essential to developing vibrant economies.  They are willing to use low carbon alternatives, but argue that the West should pay for it since the West had the luxury of deploying decades of high carbon growth.

"Adaptation" refers to the urgent money needed to help the most vulnerable countries adapt to the immediate challenges of a hotter planet.  Part of what makes these countries (like small island developing states) so vulnerable is rapid change and inadequate resources.  Given that these countries didn't contribute to the climate problem, any global deal will need to have significant financing.

The current Kyoto structure for financing is woefully inadequate.  There is a small tax placed on carbon credits, but it hasn't raised nearly enough money.  The article places the figure at $18 million.  Nicholas Stern says that there should be about $85 billion per year going to adaptation.

The rich countries have not agreed on a financing framework. The EU is proposing somewhere between $33-$74 billion per year.  Even if that figure was agreed to in theory, the mechanisms by which financing would be insured are uncertain.  The West generally likes to push market and private sector solutions; but the the G-77 prefers direct transfer from governments, arguing that market mechanisms can be too unpredictable.

With all of the talk in the US about emissions reductions, it is important to recognize that the North-South financing issue may be an even bigger obstacle in the journey to secure a global deal.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night <a href="http://hughbartling.com/?p=721">I posted an analysis</a> of Evanston's proposed "pilot project" to bring Chicago's Divvy bike share system to this northern suburb.  The memo from city staff does not provide ridership estimates, but does make revenue projections: $44,000 from casual users of the system and $75,000 from annual members.  From the data I have seen for other systems in the US, the number of casual users normally exceeds annual members by a comfortable margin.  This is logical in many of the big cities like Washington DC where many tourists may use the system and will pay the lower day rate instead of purchasing an annual membership.

I haven't seen any comprehensive data that translates these patterns of use into revenue.  Thanks to Steve Vance, I stumbled upon a <a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2012/05/08/bike-share-is-for-short-trips-not-four-hour-jaunts/">Streetsblog </a>post that led me to <a href="http://jdantos.wordpress.com/2012/01/18/capital-bikeshare-data-part-2/">JD Antos' blog</a> where he crunched some of the usage numbers provided by the DC operator, Capital Bikeshare.  JD's data did not include revenue, but it did include a breakdown of trip duration by casual vs. annual membership users.  He found in DC that 88% of all trips last 30 minutes or less.  He doesn't provide specific numbers for members, but he does report that casual users are more likely to keep a bike out for longer than 30 minutes than annual members.

So what does this have to do with revenues?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my course on Green Cities I always start the class on transportation planning by sharing with the students the result of a google news search I conduct the morning before class on the term <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;tbm=nws&amp;authuser=0&amp;q=%22cyclist+killed%22&amp;oq=%22cyclist+killed%22&amp;gs_l=news-cc.3..43j43i53.1116.3313.0.3467.16.7.0.0.0.0.120.544.5j2.7.0...0.0...1ac.1.xuwVZTv_Br8">"cyclist killed."</a>  There are always scores of articles documenting these tragedies throughout the United States and the world (today there were over 2000 hits).

The articles generally give the intersection or address where the fatality occurred and in class I bring up a google street view of the area and we discuss the specific problems relating to transportation planning that may have contributed to the fatality.  Of course each accident is different and we usually don't know from the news article whether the driver was drunk or whether the cyclist was riding recklessly.  Yet, in many of the sites clear problems like lack of bike lanes, streets engineered for high speeds and absence of sidewalks or shoulders are often observed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:cover {"url":"https://cldup.com/Fz-ASbo2s3.jpg","align":"wide"} -->
<div class="wp-block-cover has-background-dim alignwide" style="background-image:url(https://cldup.com/Fz-ASbo2s3.jpg)"><p class="wp-block-cover-text">Of Mountains &amp; Printing Presses</p></div>
<!-- /wp:cover -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The goal of this new editor is to make adding rich content to WordPress simple and enjoyable. This whole post is composed of <em>pieces of content</em>—somewhat similar to LEGO bricks—that you can move around and interact with. Move your cursor around and you’ll notice the different blocks light up with outlines and arrows. Press the arrows to reposition blocks quickly, without fearing about losing things in the process of copying and pasting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What you are reading now is a <strong>text block</strong> the most basic block of all. The text block has its own controls to be moved freely around the post...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"right"} -->
<p style="text-align:right">... like this one, which is right aligned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Headings are separate blocks as well, which helps with the outline and organization of your content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Handling images and media with the utmost care is a primary focus of the new editor. Hopefully, you’ll find aspects of adding captions or going full-width with your pictures much easier and robust than before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://cldup.com/cXyG__fTLN.jpg" alt="Beautiful landscape"/><figcaption>If your theme supports it, you’ll see the "wide" button on the image toolbar. Give it a try.</figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Try selecting and removing or editing the caption, now you don’t have to be careful about selecting the image or other text by mistake and ruining the presentation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The <em>Inserter</em> Tool</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine everything that WordPress can do is available to you quickly and in the same place on the interface. No need to figure out HTML tags, classes, or remember complicated shortcode syntax. That’s the spirit behind the inserter—the <code>(+)</code> button you’ll see around the editor—which allows you to browse all available content blocks and add them into your post. Plugins and themes are able to register their own, opening up all sort of possibilities for rich editing and publishing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Go give it a try, you may discover things WordPress can already add into your posts that you didn’t know about. Here’s a short list of what you can currently find there:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Text &amp; Headings</li><li>Images &amp; Videos</li><li>Galleries</li><li>Embeds, like YouTube, Tweets, or other WordPress posts.</li><li>Layout blocks, like Buttons, Hero Images, Separators, etc.</li><li>And <em>Lists</em> like this one of course :)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Visual Editing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A huge benefit of blocks is that you can edit them in place and manipulate your content directly. Instead of having fields for editing things like the source of a quote, or the text of a button, you can directly change the content. Try editing the following quote:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The editor will endeavor to create a new page and post building experience that makes writing rich posts effortless, and has “blocks” to make it easy what today might take shortcodes, custom HTML, or “mystery meat” embed discovery.</p><cite>Matt Mullenweg, 2017</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The information corresponding to the source of the quote is a separate text field, similar to captions under images, so the structure of the quote is protected even if you select, modify, or remove the source. It’s always easy to add it back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blocks can be anything you need. For instance, you may want to add a subdued quote as part of the composition of your text, or you may prefer to display a giant stylized one. All of these options are available in the inserter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[null,null,null],"columns":2} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://cldup.com/n0g6ME5VKC.jpg" alt=""/></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://cldup.com/ZjESfxPI3R.jpg" alt=""/></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://cldup.com/EKNF8xD2UM.jpg" alt=""/></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can change the amount of columns in your galleries by dragging a slider in the block inspector in the sidebar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Media Rich</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you combine the new <strong>wide</strong> and <strong>full-wide</strong> alignments with galleries, you can create a very media rich layout, very quickly:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"full"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull"><img src="https://cldup.com/8lhI-gKnI2.jpg" alt="Accessibility is important — don’t forget image alt attribute"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sure, the full-wide image can be pretty big. But sometimes the image is worth it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[null,null],"align":"wide","className":"alignwide"} -->
<ul class="wp-block-gallery alignwide columns-2 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://cldup.com/_rSwtEeDGD.jpg" alt=""/></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://cldup.com/L-cC3qX2DN.jpg" alt=""/></figure></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The above is a gallery with just two images. It’s an easier way to create visually appealing layouts, without having to deal with floats. You can also easily convert the gallery back to individual images again, by using the block switcher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any block can opt into these alignments. The embed block has them also, and is responsive out of the box:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:core-embed/vimeo {"url":"https://vimeo.com/22439234","type":"video","providerNameSlug":"vimeo","align":"wide","className":"wp-has-aspect-ratio wp-embed-aspect-16-9"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-embed-vimeo alignwide wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-has-aspect-ratio wp-embed-aspect-16-9"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://vimeo.com/22439234
</div></figure>
<!-- /wp:core-embed/vimeo -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can build any block you like, static or dynamic, decorative or plain. Here’s a pullquote block:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Code is Poetry</p><cite>The WordPress community</cite></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p style="text-align:center">
	<em>
		If you want to learn more about how to build additional blocks, or if you are interested in helping with the project, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg">GitHub repository</a>.	</em>
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:button {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-button aligncenter"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg">Help build Gutenberg</a></div>
<!-- /wp:button -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p style="text-align:center">Thanks for testing Gutenberg!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p style="text-align:center"><img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="👋" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/svg/1f44b.svg"></p>

		<title>Planned Communities and Housing Discrimination</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/13/magazine/13wwln_lede.html?ex=1313121600&en=a4d6b0fafe9226be&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">New York Times has a short article</a> in today's Magazine on the proliferation of "active adult communities" in the United States.

As baby boomers reach retirement there has been an ensuing proliferation of planned communities that forbid people younger than 18 from being residents.  This emergent demographic, being relatively affluent, has been vigorously courted by real estate developers and municipalities.

In keeping with the increasing spatial segmentation of people and residence based  on particular demographic factors, developers have responded to the market demands by offering spaces free from the perceived nuisances that accompany children and adolescents.  These developments--like the <a href="http://www.delwebb.com/Lifestyle/Default.aspx">Sun City</a> and <a href="http://www.thevillages.com/index2.htm">Villages</a> franchises--are replete with swimming pools, golf courses, and other recreational facilities whose peacefulness is ensured by restricting the types of residents.

The article explores some of the problems with this precedent.  Particularly troubling is how age-restrictive communities violate the spirit of the 1968 <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/fheo/FHLaws/yourrights.cfm">Fair Housing Act</a>.  Prior to 1968, discrimination on the basis of age, race, familial status, religion, and ethnicity was widespread and had particularly nefarious effects for minority groups.

Municipalities generally like having age-restrictive communities since seniors utilize fewer expensive public services such as education.  However, once baby boomers begin to die off, the next demographic wave will not have as many retired persons to fill these age-restrictive communities.  The result could be declining property values as supply exceeds demand.

From the standpoint of urbanism, the trend of segmentation evidenced by these age-restrictive communities continues a trend criticized by the late <a href="http://www.pps.org/info/placemakingtools/placemakers/jjacobs">Jane Jacobs</a> whereby our new suburban spaces lose their vitality as they tend to be ever-more homogenous.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Alternative Energy Policy Australia-Style</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=7">mentioned last week</a>, the issue of rising fuel prices is a cause for concern for many politicians.

Australia, like the United States, <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20099118-643,00.html">is a large importer of petroleum</a> and depends on these imports to sustain a highly consumptive, automobile-dependent, energy regime.

Unlike the United States, Australia has been pushing the use of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) as an alternative, culminating in an <a href="http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,20125267-5001021,00.html">announcement by Prime Minister John Howard last week</a> to provide a $2000 (Au.) subsidy to consumers who convert their car to accept the fuel.

From a sustainability perspective, there are numerous problems with relying on LPGs as a staple for energy policy.  First, LPGs are derivitive from butane and propane produced during oil and natural gas extraction.  As such, they don't offer an alternative to fossil fuels--rather another form.

Similarly, the fuel burns cleaner than conventional petrol, but still produces the same amount of carbon emissions, doing nothing to the pressing problem of climate change.

This subsidy seems less an attempt to engage in a more environmentally sustainable energy policy than a way to bolster political support.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With oil prices above $70 a barrel and global supplies concentrated in a relatively small number of countries it should not be surprising that countries without secure domestic supplies of oil continue to search for alternatives.

Today's <a href="http://hughbartling.blogspot.com/2006/08/south-africa-has-way-to-get-more-oil.html">Wall Street Journal reports</a> on the South African company, <a href="http://www.sasol.com">Sasol Ltd</a>, which has emerged as the global leader in developing coal-to-oil technology.  During the 1980s when international sanctions against the former apartheid reigme made it difficult for the country to import oil, Sasol was given significant amounts of government subsidies to develop technology to convert coal into a liquified form that could be used as a petroleum substitute.

With the global oil regime in a state of increasing demand and political insecurity, many coal-rich countries, like China and the United States are looking to Sasol and coal-to-oil technology to reduce their dependence on foreign oil.

From a sustainability standpoint, however, this technology offers little promise in the way of reducing envrionmental impact of energy use.  The process of producing the oil involves massive carbon emissions and the production facilities can only be viable with massive government subsidies.

As is the case with governmental policies like those discussed previously relating to liquid petroleum gas and ethanol, the push for coal-to-oil technology fails to adequately take into account all of the ecological and economic costs of our high levels of fossil fuel consumption.

It is interesting to note the inconsistencies of politicians like our junior senator from Illinois, Barak Obama, who has given recent speeches claiming that <a href="http://obama.senate.gov/speech/060403-energy_independence_and_the_safety_of_our_planet/">"the issue of climate change is one that we ignore at our own peril"</a> while simultaneously co-sponsoring Senate Bill 3325, which would give millions of dollars to the coal industry to develop a technology that would increase carbon emissions.  It is no wonder that Obama <a href="http://www.nma.org/newsroom/latest_pop/releases06/062206_coalfuelsleg.html">earned praise from the head of the major mining industry lobby</a>!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In recent days there have been interesting opinion pieces by prominent commentators about climate change and the international regimes developed to restrict human-generated carbon emissions.

The most prominent international treaty dealing with climate change is the <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/02/120&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">Kyoto Protocol</a>, which requires industrialized countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 5% of 1990 levels by 2012.  So-called "developing countries," like India and China signed the treaty, but were exempt from legally-binding reduction targets.  Developing countries were encouraged to participate in reducing carbon emissions through the <a href="http://cdm.unfccc.int/">Clean Development Mechanism</a> which allows industrialized countries to get credits for meeting their own reduction targets by funding mitigation projects in the developing world.

The main shortcoming of Kyoto is the fact that the largest polluter, the United States, has failed to ratify the treaty.  President George W. Bush has cited the fact that China and India are not obligated to reduce emissions as a reason for opposing the treaty.  The developing countries suggested that it would not be fair to demand reductions in their emissions since developed countries reaped the benefits of 150 years of massive pollution and, furthermore, the developing countries do not have the resources needed to make the change to more efficient technologies.
Earlier this week, the <a href="http://hughbartling.blogspot.com/2006/08/global-warming-fund-could-succeed-where.html">Financial Times published an editorial</a> by Columbia University economist, Jagdish Bhagwati, explaining that the Kyoto Protocol's "fatal flaw" was the exemption for reducing emissions on the part of India and China.  To induce the United States to support multilateral agreements on climate change, Bhagwati proposes that industrialized countries contribue into a fund that would pay for mitigation in the developing world as well as initiate a tax on all CO2 emissions worldwide.  The revenues generated would likewise go into mitigation efforts.  The tax would also provide incentives for voluntary efficiency measures to be undertaken.

In today's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/17/AR2006081701188.html">Washington Post, University of Chicago Law School professor, Cass Sunstein</a> similarly blames Kyoto's shortcomings on the exemptions given to emerging industrial nations like China.  He argues that agreements to address global climate change need support from China and the United States.  Although he does mischaracterize China as having "refused to participate in any international agreement to control climate change," given the fact that both countries have significant levels of emissions and little in the way of binding reduction plans, it does seem reasonable to find a way to get these two countries to participate in global efforts to reduce emissions.

Unlike Bhagwati, Sunstein does not offer much in the way of a solution.  He argues that both China and the United States are less affected by climate change than other countries and, therefore, less likely to find that it is in their self-interest to change behavior.

His argument seems to ignore the reality of the global connections that form the foundation of economic and political realities in both countries.  Countries in more extreme geographic locations may suffer more dramatic consequences than the US or China--although this is debatable--but climatic insecurities can create political and economic insecurities in these countries which the US or China may rely upon as export or import markets.

Furthermore, lumping China and the United States together as the main culprits of global climate change ignores the fact that there is a <a href="http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/SeriesDetail.aspx?srid=751&crid=">great disparity between the two countries in <em>per capita</em> emissions</a>.  The US has per capita rates of CO2 emissions at almost 20 metric tons per annum while China's rates are in the neighborhood of 3 metric tons per annum.

These disparities bring up extremely difficult questions relating to ethics which can only be resolved through multilateral discussions.  Given the fact that the United States, in particular, has generally been resistent to multilateralism over the past six years, it remains uncertain how climate change can be effectively confronted.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-0608200391aug20,1,4196286.story?coll=chi-news-hed">Chicago Tribune has an interesting story</a> on the debate over what constitutes "organic" milk.  In recent years a substantial market has emerged for organic foods as consumers fear the environmental and health impacts of factory farming.  Most of the food produced in conventional, "factory" envrionments rely on significant inputs in an effort to maximize yields.  These inputs include petroleum-based fertilizers, pesticides, and various antibiotics and hormones for livestock.

Organics, on the other hand, are often thought to be produced with minimal synthetic inputs in a more "natural" process.  As the demand for organics has grown, so has the interest of large agri-business and grocery store chains.

The article in the Tribune documents the Horizon dairy brand--owned by Dean Foods--and how they barely walk the line in conforming to USDA organic guidelines.  The example of Horizion shows some of the challenges involved in regulating organic production.  Prior to the USDA developing guidelines on what constituted "organic" production, the industry was largely self-regulating, meaning that marketers could promote products as "organic" without spelling out what was meant by the term.

Environmentalists and small organic farmers sought the regulations which came into effect in the early 2000s.  With defined regulations, however, companies like Horizon can meet the letter of the regulations without honoring the spirit of the environmental aspects of organic production.

<a href="http://www.michaelpollan.com/">Michael Pollan</a> has explored the tensions of the organics movement quite well in his numerous books and articles--many of which are available on his website.]]></content:encoded>

If interested Organically Speaking a Seattle base website has released a conversation with Michael Pollan podcast (audio conversation). Interesting tidbits on farmers markets, CSAs, and more!

Some Podcast Show Note Questions:

Q) Why the price difference between conventional food and organic and how do we go about bringing down organic food prices?

Q) How can small local organic farmers remain local in a capitalistic system?

Q) What is the "Food Web" you briefly touch on in your book, The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-060825carsonpirie,1,3318289.story?coll=chi-news-hed">week's announcement</a> by Bon-Ton Stores<font id="text"><font id="text"> that they will be closing the State Street location of </font></font><font id="text"><font id="text">Carson Pirie Scott</font></font><font id="text"><font id="text"> is the latest in a series of well-publicized changes downtown</font></font> Chicago's retail landscape.  Late last year their State Street neighbor, Marshall Field's, was swallowed up by Federated Department Stores in a large merger of the country's two top department store conglomerates.  In an effort to streamline advertising and branding costs, Federated announced that the all of the regional chains acquired in the merger--including Field's--would adopt the Macy's brand.

From the perspective of urban development, the reaction to these changes is interesting.  There was vocal opposition to the Field's name change, including a petition drive and an <a href="http://www.fieldsfanschicago.org/">impending protest</a> on 9 September when the name change becomes permanent.  The reaction to Carsons has been less dramatic--perhaps due to the fact that opposition to the Field's transition was largely ineffectal.

One of the themes that continues to emerge in local news stories about these changes on State Street was how many people expressed nostalgia and regret that the neighborhood is changing.  The <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-0608260222aug26,1,5179331.story?coll=chi-news-hed">Tribune today has an interesting article </a>that briefly reviews the history of State Street as the regional shopping mecca going back more than a century.

State Street has figured prominently in the city's identity over the years, being memorialized in the 1922 Fred Fisher song made famous by Frank Sinatra, "Chicago," wherein State Street is referred to as that "Great Street" where "they do things they don't do on Broadway."  Fisher never clearly discloses what these "things" are--although later in the song he recounts how he "saw a man and he danced with his wife"--but clearly the attempt here is to seek pride in the Chicago's status as the "Second City."

As post-War suburbanization commenced in the Chicago region during 1950s,  State Street suffered.  The big downtown stores--including Carson's and Fields--set up operations in the big regional shopping malls that were being constructed in suburbia.   These new malls, often located in proximity to the new interstate highways, offered the old downtown shopping opportunities in suburban settings closer to the burgeoning middle classes who were fleeing the city in droves.

State Street suffered accordingly and in the late 1970s, the city tried to replicate the mall atmposphere by shutting the street down to private automobile traffic.  This idea failed since the street couldn't really turn into a pedestrian mall becase there was still CTA bus and taxi traffic.  The result was a dead zone of very little street life.  The city re-opened State Street to all vehicular traffic in 1996 which coincided with the development of more residential properties in the neighborhood.  Much of the downtown shopping migrated a mile or so north to the North Michigan Avenue district.

State Street has blossomed into a very different type of neighborhood than it was--which offers a great example of the dynamism of urban spaces.  With DePaul's renovation of the old Goldblatt's department store building into classroom space, the opening of the University Center dormotory, and the Harold Washington Library serving as anchors, the neighborhood is taking on an eclectic character, merging residential, commercial, and civic functions into a different type of urban space.

Neighborhood change, however, often conflicts with peoples' preconceptions about the place.  This is especially the case when old and prominent institutions leave or change their fundamental character.  Interestingly, an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/26/business/26macy.html?ex=1314244800&en=ca91d1284f1abb07&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">article in today's New York Times</a> profiles Terry Lundgren, the CEO of Federated and the force behind changing Fields into the Macy's brand.  The article largely gives Lundgren positive marks for smoothing over the reaction against consolidating regional stores under the Macy's name.  One anecdote recounted in the story is telling:
<blockquote>To prove the point, Mr. Lundgren tells a story. Soon after Federated disclosed that Marshall Field’s, an upscale Midwest department store, would lose its name, scores of shoppers wrote blistering letters to the company, with several threatening to cut up their Field’s charge cards.

Worried that the reaction might be widespread and hurt the chain’s sales, Mr. Lundgren asked the accounting department to pull the purchase records of the first 100 letter writers. “There was no activity,” he said. “Or incredibly little activity.”

“This is where the tension was coming from,” he continued. “There was a group of people who did not want a change. But do they like the merchandise in the store? Not according to their spending. In their letters, they talked about when they were a child. But nobody was talking in the present tense.”</blockquote>
This reveals the reality of the tensions between people's identity with a prominent landmark occupying urban space and the reality of corporate interests in a period of increasing consolidation in many industries--inculding retail.  Both Field's and Carson's have long-ago been acquired by businesses with no measurable ties to the city and are facing increasing pressure by stockholders to maintain competitiveness.  These recent decisions show that the ultimate decisions made by these companies are designed with these isolated corporate interests in mind.  In fact on the same day that Bon-Ton announced the closure of the State Street Carson's, their <a href="http://www.canadianbusiness.com/markets/headline_news/article.jsp?content=D8JMQCUO0">second quarter earnings report was released</a> which failed to meet Wall Street expectations.
Of course, no one expects coporations to engage in activity that is at odds with their bottom line; however, private interests invariably have effects on public spaces.  The inevitible tension that results provides the substance of much social and political interest.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There are two interesting stories in today's national press relating to some of the under-reported aspects of contemporary suburbanization.

In the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/25/AR2006082501197.html">Washington Post, Michael Grunwald</a> has an article on how issues of affordable housing are being increasingly felt in the suburbs.  One of the advantages of post-World War Two suburbanization has been a marked increase in relatively affordable housing--albeit highly subsidized by the federal government.  As scholars such as <a href="http://semcoop.booksense.com/NASApp/store/Product?s=showproduct&isbn=0195049837">Kenneth Jackson</a> have argued, federal government policies related to mortgage insurance, highway construction, and various tax deductions have been historicaly skewed towards suburban development at the expense of inner-city investment.

Over the past decade or so there has been a historic housing boom nationwide.  The combination of low interest rates, inexpensive land acquisition at the exurban fringes of major metropolitan areas, and a continuation of the aforementioned subsidies have all contributed to this boom.  Simultaneously there has been a demonstrated renaissance in various urban neighborhoods that has resulted in gentrification schemes that have pushed many low-income earners out of what were largely working-class neighborhoods.  In Chicago, neighborhoods like Pilsen, Wicker Park, and Ukrainian Village are examples of this trend.

These pressures are coupled with a general stagnation of wages for many in the middle- and lower-middle classes.  Add to this mix high fuel prices and the fact that many of the mortgages that fueled the housing boom have adjustible-rate products that are now starting to rise significantly, and we see that suburbia is now having to grapple with issues of affordability.  As Grunwald's article illustrates, increasing numbers of people are paying more than 30% of their income--the traditional measure of affordability.  In practical terms, many people are now having to travel many miles to find pockets of affordability.
These increasing commutes are taking place in a context that is deficient in mass transit.  With more and more people commuting long distances in suburbia, air quality inevitably suffers in many locales.  In the Central Valley of California, officials have sought to take a novel approach to dealing with this effect.  As today's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/us/27build.html?ex=1314331200&en=5570cf8a05848368&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">New York Times reports</a>, the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District is requiring developers to pay a pollution mitigation fee for developments that exacerbate low-density sprawl.

It's not surprising that developers are taking the district to court to overturn the tax, but it does represent an interesting attempt at getting pollution-generating projects to pay their social impact.]]></content:encoded>

The debate typifies two often incompatible trends seen in American suburbia:  the desire for a safe, conforming landscape on the one hand, and the desire for individual freedom, on the other.

Proponents of the ban argue that RV's and boats detract from the aesthetics of suburban residential neighborhoods (and property values) while opponents feel that they should have the right to store their vehicles on their own property.

Generally in these disputes the "property values" contingent trumps other interests.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=7">earlier</a><a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=7"> posts</a>, I have highlighted the efforts underway to develop biofuels as a possible substitutes for fossil fuels.

There is considerable debate amongst environmentalists about the viability of biofuels given the fact that they require massive amounts of land, they are highly subsidized, and they contribute a mono-culture agricultural system that has ancilary ecological problems related to biodiversity and water quality.

The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/business/08crop.html?ex=1315368000&en=5159954fa16727e2&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">New York Times today has an interesting article</a> that will further the controversy.  Apparently chemical companies, such as DuPont, are concentrating research and development into the use of genetically modified versions of corn and soybeans that stand up better to the processes required to formulate plants into fuel.

There are certain properties of these plants that interfere with the processing of their cellulose into ethanol which, the GM proponents believe, can be modified making refining easier.

Environmentalists and some farmers see this as a problem, as the <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/business/stories.nsf/0/0FD9310610A2673F862571E200080498?OpenDocument">GM plants can mix with non-GM varieties</a>.  Many of the GM varieties are not tested for human consumption, which <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/Technology/EU-says-food-importers-should-do-more-to-keep-out-geneticallymodified-products/2006/09/06/1157222141705.html">upsets some of our major trading partners</a>, like the European Union.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Dr. Bartling,

This is Adrian from your Sustainable Development Course. I am currently interning with the Foresight Design Initiative, a sustainable design firm here in Chicago that is planning to hold their Sustainable Convergence Party at the MCA to coincide with the exhibits there. It costs a little bit to attend but there are cheaper prices for students, but the event will be great for anyone who wants to meet more people within Chicago's sustainability community. The people who already plan to attend are government officials, non-profit organization staff members, designers of all sorts, urban planners, and alot of others interested in a wide-variety of sustainabilty issues. Also there is going to be alot of free stuff. Although there are free nights on Tuesdays, I still think this would be the best way to check out the new exhibit. If you are thinking about attending please go to the website at: www.foresightdesign.org/converge06/. Thanks for letting me use your blog as a billboard.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today's Financial Times has three notworthy artiles on the general theme of sustainability and agriculture. The <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d191adbc-3f4d-11db-a37c-0000779e2340.html">first</a> <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/46cd2578-3f5a-11db-a37c-0000779e2340.html">two</a> chronicle the problems of certifying "fair trade" coffee.  The fair trade movement emerged over the last decade or so as a way for consumers from developed, Western countries to purchase goods originating from less-developed countries that insured that workers received a fair wage and that the products were produced in and environmentally sustainable manner.

Fair trade can be thought of as an alternative to corporate-dominated globalization which relies on lax environmental and labor rules to produce cheap goods for Western consumption.  The main problem uncovered by the Financial Times investigation has been that it is very difficult to actually insure that "fair trade" products are actually produced fairly.  The fact that the production of crops like coffee occur in small, isolated places makes it easy for producers to skirt the fair trade guidelines by planting in sensitive environments and paying workers less than the minimum wage.

Since consumers have little independent means to verify the efficacy of the certification process, there is little incentive on the part of coffee retailers to insure their coffee is produced fairly.  An exception to this is the Chicago-based <a href="http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/">Intelligentsia</a>, which had cut its ties with the farms investigated by the FT several months ago.

In the FT Weekend section of the paper, they <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d9c18fd4-3e30-11db-b4de-0000779e2340.html">print a review</a> of two recent books by the journalist Michael Pollan (<a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/18-1594200823-0"><em>The Omnivore's Dilemma</em></a>) and Princeton bio-ethicist Peter Singer <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-157954889x-0">(<em>The Way We Eat: Why Our Food Choices Matter</em></a>) on the problems of our dominant industrial food systems.

I have yet to read either book, but Pollan has written interesting work in the past questioning the corporatization of the organic movement and arguing that local food systems are more environmentally sustainable.  Singer looks at ethical issues of eating, which would not only include the rather brutal treatment of animals in the production process, but also how the ways in which we eat contribute to systems of ecological and social exploitation.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think that fair-trade is a great choice for coffee co-operatives that can afford it, but I do think it is important for consumers to ask questions of the companies that are providing products labeled as fair-trade.

Also, if a coffee company isn't purchasing certified fair trade products there may be an explanation that is worth listening to. some companies offer "fairly traded" coffee that is not certified by the FLO because the FLO has several fees for both on the producer and the buyer which makes it difficult for very small farmers to make a substantial profit and also increases the price buyers are paying...

On the producers end
The FLO charges fees between 2,000 -5,200 euros plus a volume fee to become a certified producer.

On the buyers end
Coffee is usually about $1.20/ lb for the buyer where non fair trade coffee is usually under $1.00/ lb however in addition to paying more for certified fair trade buyers must also pay $0.05 per lb of coffee bought and $0.15 cents per lb of organic coffee.

http://www.transfairusa.org/content/certification/producer_certification_fees.php

i think these added fees - while supporting the FLO and allowing them to hire more people to inspect farms and enforce their high standards, actually makes it more difficult for the co-operatives to do business.

buy purchasing "fairly traded" rather than "fair trade" coffee, while there is no guarantee that the coffee is produced in similar fashion as fair trade it does allow the both the buyer and the producer to escape those high fees.... which might be very important to companies who want to support small farmers who are not a part of a cooperative (which you must be to join Transfair)

it can definitely be a difficult choice for the consumer... but if people choose to buy coffee from awesome companies like Intelligensia or Metropolis - I think they can ask about the companies buying practices...

So when you go to buy your next cup of coffee or bag to take home... just ask... "How much do you guys pay per pound?"  If they answer above $1.20/ lb than that is what farmers on fair trade farms are receiving. If they don't want to answer your question or are unaware of coffee labor issues, you may want to take your business elsewhere.

while this doesn't fix the problem of laborers making fair wages, it does allow the consumer to make a more educated decision about the coffee they choose.

finally as the FT article mentioned - the owners of intelligensia are going to the farms where they buy coffee, Metropolis does too when they source products, so if you talk to the owners they can tell you about their experience on the farms and how workers are treated.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>The Ontario-Michigan Trash Wars</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For several years now, Toronto and other Ontario municipalities have been exporting large amounts of their municipal solid waste to Michigan.  The international garbage trade is longstanding--perhaps the most infamous incident took place in 1986 when a barge called the Kihan Sea picked up hazardous incinerator ash from Philadelphia and sailed around the world trying to find a place to dump it before convincing the poor country of Haiti to accept the shipment.

The incident was highly publicized and raised questions about which countries should take the responsiblity for waste they have produced.  Generally the more developed countries of North America and Europe were the exporters.

In the early 2000s, with small Ontario communities rejecting expanding or constructing landfills to accomodate the Toronto metropolitan area's garbage, the provincial government looked south to Michigan for an outlet.  For Michigan, a declining manufacturing sector and the need for jobs and revenues contributed to an acceptance of the expansion of a dump 30 miles southwest of Detroit.

Once it became publicized that Toronto was <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0802/p04s01-woam.html">shipping 73,000 pounds</a> of solid waste to Michigan per day, many citizens of Michigan became upset and demanded action from state leadership.

However, because the North American Free Trade Agreement insures that the borders between the US and Canada are open for the exchange of goods--including garbage--there has been little that state politicians could do.  International affairs is the purview of the federal government and <a href="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060910/OPINION01/609100304/1008">critics argue</a> that restrictive trade laws dealing with one particular state are potentially unconstitutional.

In the absence of federal legislation, last week Michigan's Governor, Debbie Stabenow, <a href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1157061023365&call_pageid=968332188492">signed an agreement</a> with the Ontario's Premier, Dalton McGuinty to phase out municipal waste from the Greater Toronto Area.

This <a href="http://www.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060912/OPINION02/609120313/1087/opinion">doesn't stop all of the trash flow</a>--private haulers and certain categories of commercial waste are exempt from the agreement.  Nevertheless, it is a unique agreement but questions remain about its long term viability given the fact that it is not legally binding.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>World Health Oraganization Pushes Use of DDT in Low-Income Countries</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=20</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://hughbartling.blogspot.com/2006/09/who-calls-for-spraying-controversial.html">Wall Street Journal reports</a> on the <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr50/en/index.html">recent endorsement</a> by the World Health Organization--the United Nations public health arm--for the use of the insecticide DDT as a way to prevent the spread of malaria in Africa and Asia.

DDT was sprayed extensively throughout the United States during the 1950s without a real understanding of its environmental consequences.  Rachel Carson's popular book, <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-0618249060-0"><em>Silent Spring</em></a>, was published in 1962 and made an argument that DDT's use contributed to declining bird and fish populations and constituted a direct threat to human health.  The book made quite a splash and, some argue, was the impetus for the US government's effective ban on the use of DDT some years later.

The insecticide has been legal throughout the world, however, and many poor countries have used it as a short-term cost-effective measure against malaria-spreading mosquitos.

Malaria kills <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/14/AR2006091401172.html">approximately 1 million people per year</a>, but the long-term ecological effects of the insecticide's widespread use are often ignored by cash-poor governments.

With the WHO endorsing the indoor use of DDT, international lenders such as the World Bank will likely provide more money to DDT projects.  Ignored in the embrace of DDT, however, are other policy alternatives, such as eradicating mosquito breeding grounds and developing a malaria vaccine.  These alternatives would generally cost more, but they would likely be effective and not have as many detrimential ecological consequences.

Former Chicago Tribune reporter, <a href="http://www.gooznews.com/archives/000487.html">Merrill Goozner has an interesting interview</a> with Janet Hemmingway, a British expert in tropical medicine who recent received a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop alternative insecticides.  The Gates Foundation has also put money toward developing a malaria vaccine.

The issue pressing--particularly in parts of Africa.  Not only are their hundreds of thousands of people dying due to the disease, but the widespread use of DDT could also threaten African exports, as <a href="http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/220/521097">important importers like the European Union have restrictions</a> on importing commodities that come into contact with DDT .]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/15/AR2006091500865.html">The latest outbreak of E.coli has been linked</a> to bagged spinach produced by the ironically-named Natural Selection Foods, based in California.  Given the nature of E. coli and its ability to quickly and quietly infect proximate food, there may still be other products infected by the deadly virus.

The current problems facing Natural Selection Foods, which sells its produce under both its <a href="http://www.ebfarm.com/">Earthbound Farm Organic </a>brand and through the private brands of companies like Trader Joe's, is a good example of the ways in which the organic foods industry has changed over the last couple of decades.

Moving from a rather insignificant percentage of food production to a large segement of the marketplace in relatively quick order, contemporary organic production has become more like industrial agriculture--mono-cultural, large-scale, and increasingly consolidated.  These characteristics undermine the integrative, ecological understandings of organics that many consumers still see as the major advantage of these products over conventionally-produced foods.

The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/16/business/16milk.html?ex=1316059200&en=685cfeac04cb581a&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">New York Times has a good article today</a> on how these tensions are being experienced in the organic dairy industry as Wal Mart gets more involved in selling organic products.  It seems that their main supplier--<a href="http://www.auroraorganic.com/aodweb/site/">Aurora Organic Dairy</a>--arranges its dairy operation more on an industrial model.  It <a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/Organic/aurora012405.cfm">confines its cows</a>, gives them a diet dominant in corn-feed rather than the more natural grass, and milks them with great frequency.  The Wisconsin-based watchdog group, The <a href="http://cornucopia.org/pasture/index.php">Cornucopia Institute</a>, filed a complaint earlier this year with the US Department of Agriculture charging that Aurora is <a href="http://www.longmontfyi.com/Local-Story.asp?id=7121">not compliant with organic standards</a>.

The food blog, <a href="http://www.ethicurean.com/2006/07/22/review-organic-inc/">The Ethicurean</a>, has a nice review of a recent book by <a href="http://www.fromartz.com/main.php?sn=sn4&pc=oi8">Samuel Fromartz</a> called, <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?inkey=62-0151011303-0&PID=30872&PID=30872">Organic Inc.</a>, which looks at the development of the organic movement into a large-scale industry.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wal-Mart scored a victory here in Illinois this week as the Chicago City Council <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=aKH_jfazzUZ4&refer=us">failed to uphold</a> Mayor Daley's veto of the big-box minimum wage law that was aimed at the country's largest retailer.

The company's problems continue elsewhere, however.  In Hercules, California--a bedroom community in the suburban Bay-area county of Contra Costa--the city is <a href="http://www.contracostatimes.com/mld/cctimes/news/local/states/california/15516107.htm">continuing its pursuit of undeveloped property</a> owned by Wal-Mart as part of its redevelopment efforts.

In Hercules, the effort to stop Wal-Mart is motivated less by the company's notorious labor practices than by the potential impact a large store will have on issues of community identity, environmental impact, and civic design.  <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/07/HO166288.DTL">Hercules has been at the forefront</a> of California communities in embracing the New Urbanist town planning framework.    New Urbanism argues for mixed-use and pedestrian friendly development--pretty much the antithesis to what Wal-Mart's generally bring to a community.

Wal-Mart has owned a desirable piece of property on the town's waterfront for a number of years, but has been unable to get approval to build its store <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/05/24/BAGM8J15531.DTL">due to its failure to meet development restrictions</a> that were in place prior to the company's acquisition of the property.

Given Wal-Mart's recalcitrance, the city is now trying to pursue a forced acquisition of the property by using its strengthened eminent domain powers.   This should be an important case to follow, as Hercules' approach could be followed by other communities seeking to challenge big box development.]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote><font id="text"><font id="text"> The recent census figures show the poverty rate in suburban Cook County rose to 8.2 percent in 2005, up from 6.4 percent in 1999. The figure was 5.3 percent in 1989.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In his post-Presidency days Bill Clinton has established a high-profile humanitarian effort called the <a href="http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?&pid=346&srcid=-2">Clinton Global Initiative</a>.  The purpose of the initiative is to bring together global power-brokers annually who pledge to develop a particular project that will contribute to resolving a pressing social problem.  If you don't follow through on your commitment, you don't get invited back the following year.

It may not be sufficient enough to solve all of the world's problems, but the results-based approach is rather ambitious. This year one of the issues the CGI is tackling is climate change and today, Sir Richard Branson--the head of the British-based Virgin conglomerate--<a href="http://environment.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,,1878492,00.html">pledged $3 billion </a>to address global warming.

The sum is staggering.  However, Bronson's pledge is to invest the money in one of his own start-up companies, Virgin Fuels.  The company has been in the works for several months with the goal to expand research into cellulosic ethanol.  Branson has a distinct business interest in the development of biofuels, as his airline company could benefit greatly from lower fuel costs.

Whether this initiative will really be able to solve global warming is debatable.  Ethanol is currently highly subsidized and requires a significant amount of energy & water intensive inputs.  Furthermore, Bronson's supposed "philanthropy" within the context of the Clinton Global Initiative is suspect given the fact that <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/02/06/8367961/">he was going to invest hundreds of millions of dollars</a> anyway into this project.

Nevertheless, I expect Sir Richard to be invited back to New York next year.

In the interim, Friday is the last day of this year's meetings and there is an interesting session on <a href="http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?&pid=716&srcid=586">"Cities of the Future"</a> featuring Jaime Lerner, the former mayor of Curitaba, Brazil--a city known for innovative sustainable urban development schemes.  Today featured sessions on <a href="http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?&pid=713&srcid=586">"Building a Sustainable Future"</a> featuring Al Gore and <a href="http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?&pid=711&srcid=586">"Energy and Climate Change."</a>

The seemingly insignificant practice of leaving a cell phone plugged into a charger after the phone is fully charged is a prime example of a cumulatively collossal waste of energy.  The Cnet article indicates that if 10% of the world's cell phone users unplugged their phone upon full recharge, enough electricity would be saved to power 60,000 European homes.

Under this scheme, the cell phone manufacturers will develop alerts on the phones which will give an indication when a phone is fully charged.

The significance of this step is hard to determine, but it represents a common practice on the part of large industrial producers of polluting commodities: developing voluntary changes in corporate practice in order to stave off governmental regulation.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Environmental Impact of 300 Million People</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0926/p01s01-ussc.html">Christian Science Monitor</a> has a pretty basic article today on environmental challenges facing the United States as the nation's population reaches 300 million people.

The article mentions such things as the rising amount of farmland being changed to development and the fact that new land development is rising at a rate twice as fast as population.  These issues are significant, but in framing the issue as one of simple population increases, it obscures the real challenge: <em>how</em> the nearly 300 million Americans live and the ecological processes that support this particular way of life.

The problem is less the raw number of people and the rate of population growth; rather it is the fact that per capita consumption of ecological space far surpasses that of other countries.  The article does mention the <a href="http://www.footprintnetwork.org/">"ecological footprint"</a> of the US, but doesn't unpack the global processes that undergird our practice of mass consumption.  Instead, it goes on to talk about federal environmental legislation enacted a year ago and fails to mention the fact that many of the important enviornmental protections have been eroded by lax regulatory enforcement and redefinitions over the past several years.

The article does have a telling graphic, however, that compares the US to other countries' ecological footprints:

		<title>The Cause of Water Pollution: Wildlife?</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=27</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/28/AR2006092801994.html">Washington Post reports</a> on some new research coming out of the DC metro area that suggests that geese, bears, deer, livestock, and other wildlife are major contributors to rising levels of bacteria in the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers.

<img title="Bacteria Levels" alt="Bacteria Levels" src="http://media3.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2006/09/29/GR2006092900032.gif" />

The article contends that the high percentages of bacteria are the result of "unnaturally high populations of deer, geese and raccoons living in modern suburbs and depositing their waste there."

Of course one of the reasons that there are "unnaturally high populations" is because low-intensity suburban sprawl destroys prevailing ecological systems and certain species are better able to adapt than others.  Curiously, these species are the ones tagged by the article as the "wildlife" responsible for the high levels of pollution.

Thus, it doesn't seem entirely accurate to talk of "wildlife" waste as something emanating separately from human activities.   In fact, high populations of one of the more polluting species--non-migratory Canadian geese--are apparently decendents of geese brought to the mid-Atlantic region as hunting decoys.

The distinctions between "wildlife" and human behavior are not quite so clear.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I don't particularly like how this article is set up. The whole article spends time focusing on the amount of pollution that wildlife causes and doesn't talk AT ALL about how much pollution is caused by humans, pets and livestock. In all three of their examples those numbers make up 40-48% of the pollution. I think the EPA and other groups should be focusing on how to reduce our impact, and the impact of pets and livestock whom people ultimately have "control" over. Wildlife cannot and will not change their "Pooping" patterns and it would be silly for people to waste time on trying to scheme up a plan to to change where they are dropping waste.

I also wonder about the overall impact in each river - The article does not address what percentage of the river was tested and whether the majority of the areas tested were urban, suburban, or sparsely populated. I find it a little hard to believe that 1.1 million geese are having a greater impact 100 million people and 100 million cattle that are populating the eastern coast of the United States.

one more thing that is disappointing about this study, and not necessarily in the study itself...but the article does not address synthetically produced chemical based toxins in the water and what percent of pollution these make up.

this seems like a pretty silly spin on our environmental problems...]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>India&#039;s Water Problem</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Along with China, India has had one of the most dynamically-growing economies over the last decade.  The country has quickly emerged as a center for both technology and manufacturing serving the global marketplace as a result of its relatively robust education system and low labor costs.

That growth, however, has not occured without problems.  The New York Times has recently published a three-part series on the challenges posed by growth on the country's water supplies.

The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/29/world/asia/29water.html?ex=1317182400&en=ca00b40fd12b722c&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">first article</a> looks at the pressing problem of water provision in India's cities.  High levels of urban growth and the failure of the government to invest in sewers and water pipes makes simply finding water a full time job for many urban dwellers.  This problem is found throughout the world, but the article shows how many people in the middle classes are having problems finding water.  One of the main problems is the polluted Yamuna River into which <a href="http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=202196">raw sewage and industrial pollutants</a> are deposited.
The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/30/world/asia/30water2.html?ex=1317268800&en=220b8ca559ef3a46&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">second article</a> looks at the problem of ground water depletion and how the scarcity of water is turning people who happen to own land fortunate to sit atop underground aquifer into water merchants.  Increased demand results in digging wells deeper and deeper and, in turn, minimizing recharge rates.  The article indicates that the intensive extraction of water above recharge levels is unsustainable over the long term.

Finally, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/01/world/asia/01india.html?ex=1317355200&en=a335a25e6bb265cb&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">third article</a> shows how a series of fundamental changes to part of the country's hyrdological systems has made many communities vulnerable during monsoon seasons.  Damed rivers face the possibilities of breaches with the fast and intense percipitation that accompanies monsoon season.  As a result, local officials often have to open reservoir gates during periods of high rain.  The article reports that 120 people died this past summer when the Ukai Dam was opened without warning, flooding downstream communities.

Issues of water provision and management are core environmental policies that could severly threaten India's growth if they are continually ignored.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://hughbartling.blogspot.com/2006/10/yes-in-my-backyard.html">Wall Street Journal had a great report</a> on the front page yesterday about the town of Sauget, Illinois--a suburb just across the river from St. Louis.

As small communities struggle to attract economic development in a competitive environment, Sauget seems to have carved out a unique niche:  attract various unattractive industries.

Sauget was initially developed in 1926 as an industrial site to house operations--and employees--for the Monsanto chemical company.  In the pre-EPA era, Monsanto sited extremely hazardous operations in Sauget where they produced PCBs for many years.

With the banning of PCBs, the city diversified and attracted a whole host of other polluting industries making it one of the most <a href="http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/nar1655.htm">polluted places in Illinois</a>.

Unlike other <a href="http://www.aurora-il.org/communitydevelopment/downtowndevelopment/index.asp">cities in the state</a> who are trying to transform their economies from an industrial focus to being more sustainable, Sauget is sticking to its tried and true plan.  In addition to being hospitible to normally-shunned businesses like strip clubs, Sauget is also being helped by the state to continue to attract other polluting industries--as evidenced by the <a href="http://www.commerce.state.il.us/dceo/News/pr06052006.htm">recent announcement by Gov. </a><span id="newsDescription"><a href="http://www.commerce.state.il.us/dceo/News/pr06052006.htm">Blagojevich</a> to give more than $2 million to a British Zinc processing company to purchase and expand a pre-existing plant.</span>

Sauget certainly has the right to attract any business it sees fit--however, the polluting nature of many of these businesses have historically had effects on regional ecological processes.  Because of the autonomy of municipal governments like Sauget, however, there is often little that can be done by neighboring communities to resist regional polluters.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The developers of a major New Urbanist planned community in Chesterton, Indiana--about 45 miles east of Chicago--have changed course.  <a href="http://www.post-trib.com/news/81250,coffee.article">According to the Gary Post-Tribune</a>, the Coffee Creek Center is no longer going to try and be <a href="http://www.coffeecreekcenter.com/">"a neo-traditional community setting standards in land use sustainability, ecology & quality of life."</a>

Instead, the new developer is seeking to build a large shopping mall or perhaps a big box retail development along with a standard single-family home residential district.

This represents an interesting phenomenon.  Over the past decade, "new urbanist" developments with integrated housing and commercial districts, pedestrian-friendly environments, and ample public spaces have attracted the attention of large-scale real estate developers.  Modeled after successful projects like <a href="http://www.celebration.fl.us/">Celebration, Florida,</a> developers found a new market niche that could be pitched as an alternative to the typical "cookie cutter" sprawl developments.

According to the article, sales for Coffee Creek were anemic.  It is unclear whether the recent downturn in the housing market is to blame for this, or rather changing consumer preferences.  Nevertheless it will be interesting to see if this is a harbinger for a general retreat from New Urbanism.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Cutting CO2 Emissions in Japan</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=32</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Takamitsu Sawa--a prominent policy analyst working on environmental issues in Japan--has an <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20061009ts.html">informative article in the Japan Times</a> on how Japan might reduce its CO2 emissions.

His main policy recommendation is to build more light-rail lines.  Tokyo--being one of the most densely-populated places on the planet--has a pretty expansive train and subway system and an expressway system that used in excess of its capacity.  However, many other cities in the country are less-equipped.

Sawa argues in favor of a system that has parking on the outskirts of the smaller urban areas where people could then transfer to light-rail to reach inner-city destinations.  He is less explicit about how such systems would be financed.

Kiyohito Utsunomiya wrote a <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/www.jrtr.net/jrtr38/pdf/f10_uts.pdf">short article (.pdf)</a> a couple of years ago in the <em>Japan Railway and Transport Review</em> making a more detailed case for light-rail transit and he nicely compares Japan to other countries.  The main obstacle facing Japan is the history of not subsidizing transit.  Utsunomiya notes a few examples from the 1990s where the national government gave some assistance for capital improvements, but railways are expected to generate enough fares to meet operating expenses.

<img src="http://www.pinktentacle.com/images/ticket_gates.jpg" />

Another unique way rail systems can contribute to energy savings is documented in the Real Tech News blog.  They <a href="http://www.realtechnews.com/posts/3353">report on efforts</a> by East Japan Railway Company to harness the energy produced by each passenger when they push the turnstyles at stations to power the electronic systems that monitor fare cards and grant access to the stations.

This type of energy micro-production stands in stark contrast to conventional wisdom where by energy needs are provided by large-scale industrial facilities.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>10 Most Polluted Places on Earth</title>

At this time of year, as the Autumn Quarter wanes and the work of writing (and grading) papers and exams occupy our days and nights, those of us in the academic community can ease the anxiety by realizing that the December break is just on the horizion.  The promise of exotic travel after a stressful quarter can keep us focused down the stretch.

With that in mind, it is important to come to the table armed with information about possible destinations for fun and relaxation.  While most people think of Puerto Vallarta, the Bahamas, or some other warm locale as the site for a December holiday, the good folks at the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6063344.stm">BBC give us some other alternatives to consider</a>.
Susi--a student in my Sustainable Development class--tipped me off to the BBC's list of the top 10 polluted places on earth.  Reporting on a recent study by the <a href="http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/ten.php">Blacksmith Institute</a> which solicited input from scientists and environmentalists throughout the globe, it seems that Russia has the dubious honor of hosting three sites in the top ten.

Many of the sites on the list are relics of the Soviet military-industrial complex.  Places like Chernobyl, Ukraine join Dzerzinsk, Russia [a major center for chemical weapons production] and the uranium processing  town of Mailuu-Suu, Kyrgystan as toxic reminders of the Cold War.

Developing countries are well-represented on the list as well.  Linfen--the center of the Chinese coal industry--and Ranipet, India are both examples of the dark underbelly of recent economic growth in the two countries.

In the Caribbean, Bajos de Hania in the Dominican Republic made the cut.  Apparently Hania is the site of a shut-down automobile battery "recycling" plant, which happened to emit tons of lead into the community.

This report reminded me of the <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/1,70507-0.html">Top Ten Most Polluted Cities in the US</a> list published by Forbes last year.  The winner:  Los Angeles.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Illinois Gubernatorial Candidates on Growth Issues</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's election season here in the United States and in Illinois we are seeing a race for the Governor's office.  Republican Judy Barr Topinka and Green Party candidate Rich Whitney are battling to unseat incumbent Democrat Rod <font id="text"><font id="text">Blagojevich.</font></font>

It is an interesting race given the troubles Republicans are having nationally, Blagojevich's ethics problems, and the fact that Whitney is polling well for a third party candidate.

<a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/2006/State%20Polls/October%202006/IllinoisGovernor.htm">The latest poll [Oct. 15] by the non-partisan Rasmussen Reports</a> shows Blagojevich 44%, Topinka 36%, and Whitney 9%.  Since that poll was taken, however, one of <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/custom/newsroom/chi-061027levine,1,2759660.story?coll=chi-news-hed">Blagojevich's associates pleaded guilty</a> to using his state appointment to take kickbacks from firms with an interest in getting state business and <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-0610270192oct27,1,4748343.story?coll=chi-news-hed">his wife earned six-figures in a real estate deal</a> involving friends who have received no-bid contracts from the state.

One would expect these latest revelations to further erode Blagojevich's slim lead over Topinka.  He seems to be trying to lay low as <a href="http://www.fox28.com/News/index.php?ID=7145">he backed out</a> from a previously-scheduled debate with his challengers.

One of the things that has been sorely missing from the campaign has been a discussion of actual public policy challenges facing the state.  <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-governorpol-storygallery,1,7150922.storygallery?coll=chi-politics-stories">The Chicago Tribune has done some good reporting</a> in this regard and had all three candidates answer important questions in relative detail.

One of the major problems facing the northeastern part of the state has been the lack of planning for metropolitan growth.  Roads are inadequate to handle demand and public transit is non-existent.  In theory, state government  has quite a bit of authority to address growth and regional infrastructure.  The Tribune asked each candidate about their transportation plans which are central to regional policy.

The headline of Tribune transportation reporter Jon Hilkevitch's article--<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/southsouthwest/chi-0610260141oct26,1,6890529.story?coll=chi-newslocalssouthwest-hed">"All candidates lack plans for roads, transit"</a>--pretty much tells the story.,

Governor Blagojevich claims that <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-0609250130sep25,1,7042101.story?coll=chi-politics-utiltop">he has been unable to get Republicans in the legislature</a> to agree to a bond-issue that would raise $2.3 billion for roads and $425 million for transit.  Passage of the bond issue would allow for the state to be eligible for more than $3 billion in federal matching funds.

Topinka wants to put a casino in Chicago to help fund road improvements.  <a href="http://chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=21819">This seems to be her answer to every policy problem</a>, as her casino plan is also supposed to fund schools, offer property tax relief, and supplant part of the state gas tax!  Many observers think that the expansion of gambling in the state is a tough sell.  <a href="http://chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=12450">Daley has unsuccessfully tried in the past</a> to get state authorization for a Chicago casino and the fact that there are already multiple casinos in the state would make it a huge political fight.  Plus, the amount of money she is suggesting could be raised from a Chicago casino is questionable.  Daley claimed two years ago that revenues would be between $200-$700 million.  Topinka's proposals require at least $4 billion!

Whitney has said that he is dedicated to developing mass transit options
both in the Chicago area, as well as improving rail service downstate.  It is unclear how he would pay for it, however.

In the next week or so I will run down the candidates' positions on a variety of environmental issues.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The British newspaper, <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/article1932727.ece">The Independent, is reporting</a> on a meeting yesterday of Tony Blair's cabinet where they heard a presentation by Sir Nicholas Stern--a former World Bank economist--indicating that the effects of climate change will likely have substantial negative impact on the world's economies.

Sir Nicholas was asked by Gordon Brown to prepare a report on the economic consequences of climate change, <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm">which will be released on Monday</a>.

According to the article, the numbers presented by Sir Nicholas were staggering.  If a dramatic reversal of course is not taken in the next 15 years countries could be spending upwards of 20% of their gross domestic product on various environmental catastrophes.

Blair is hoping that the economic analysis of Sir Nicholas will convince the United States--the largest emitter of greenhouse gases--to soften its stance on joining international agreements to mitigate climate change.  Whether Bush can be convinced of the severity of the issue is questionable.  Nevertheless, the report is likely to be a major topic of conversation at next month's <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_12/items/3754.php">UN Climate Change Conference in Nairobi</a>.

The US will likely have an observer delegation in Nairobi, but I haven't been able to figure out who will be leading it.  There are some <a href="http://itsgettinghotinhere.org/605">North American youth activists</a> travelling to Africa to join with <a href="http://www.ayicc.org/">global youth</a> participating in the conference.  Follow their <a href="http://itsgettinghotinhere.org/">blog</a> as the conference commences next month.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static.flickr.com/117/281341885_c8cf680ee6_m.jpg" /> The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/28/us/28mountains.html?ex=1319688000&en=f6ac38a7cf9b35a4&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">New York Times has a report today</a> on mountaintop removal and the ways in which citizens in Appalachia are organizing to resist the practice.

Mountaintop removal is a form of coal mining that has became popular and cost-effective for coal companies in the last decade.  Instead of drilling into the mountain to mine the coal, this method simply takes the "top" of the mountain to create a more open pit for mining.  All of the waste is then dumped into adjacent valleys.

The environmental impacts of this practice are devastating.  The loss of trees increases the likelihood for flooding and hyrdological systems are contaminated by the waste.

There was a backlash against the practice in the 1990s, led by such groups as <a href="http://www.kftc.org/">Kentuckians for the Commonwealth</a>, resulted in modest regulations during the late part of the decade.   However, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6462-2004Aug16.html">under the Bush administration, the rules for depositing the waste have been significantly relaxed</a>, leading to an increase in the employment of the removal technique.

Today's Times article frames the resistance as a "new" phenomenon whereby residents are appealing to their "faith" as a justification for resisting the practice and are using churches as the insitutional foundation for organizing.  The article has a bit of the typical East Coast condescending attitude, implying that "faith" is being used in the absence of "rationality" in guiding citizen criticism of the practice.

In reality, the role of religious institutions as important civic spaces for resisting environmental exploitation is long-standing.  In fact, the environmental justice movement in the United States traces its origin to strong community organizing with prominent roles filled by religious leaders.  In 1982, the resistance of the predominantly African American residents of Warren County, North Carolina to the siting of a hazardous waste landfill relied upon religious institutions and the 1987 groundbreaking study on "Toxic Waste and Race in the United States" was sponsored by the United Church of Christ.

For more information on the grassroots origins of the environmental justice movement, Robert Bullard's classic study, <a href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/010-278/010-278.html"><em>Dumping in Dixie</em></a>, still retains its relevance.]]></content:encoded>

Based on current levels of emissions, the EU will reduce emissions to 0.6% of 1990 levels by 2010.  Under Kyoto, they are obliged to reduce emissions to 8% of 1990 levels by 2012.

The countries that are most exceeding their allowances are ones that are experiencing the highest rates of economic growth, like Spain, Portugal and Ireland.  <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/1488&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">The emissions figures for each individual country can be found on the European Comission's webpage</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Problems With Growth Fees in Maryland</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=39</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/28/AR2006102800750.html">Washington Post has an article today assessing the "growth tax"</a> that has been in effect in suburban Montgomery County, Maryland for the past two and a half years.  In 2003 the County Council passed a tax on all new homes being built in the county to pay for the requisite road improvements and school expansions associated with suburban growth.

This is a strategy being employed or debated throughout the country as the real estate boom of the last several years resulted in signifianct stress placed on suburan municipalities.  More and more building resulted in more and more people and demand for services.  Because the rate of growth is dictated by the market, municipalities often don't have the revenue to initiate infrastructure improvements before demand emerges.  Existing residents, meanwhile, are less than enthusiastic to have to pay up front for the service demand generated by new arrivals.  Thus, taxes such as this one are established to help get growth to "pay for itself."

In the case of Montgomery County, however, developers were given a four month window before the tax went into effect.  The Post's analysis suggests that developers took advantage of the grace period and applied for permits in advance in order to get their projects in the pipeline before they had to pay the tax.  The problem, of course, is that revenues were less than expected while the costs associated with growth increased.

The other problem pointed to in the article is the fact that revenues generated from this tax are subject to the fluctuations of the housing market, making it difficult to plan long-term financing for the large-scale infrastructure projects the tax is meant to serve.

These types of taxes will probably continue to be adopted throughout the country as municipalities search for ways to pay for growth; but the grace period embraced by Montgomery County may be something that other municipalities want to question.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I mentioned Saturday, Monday will see the official release of the British economist Sir Nicholas Stern's report forcasting the economic implications of climate change.  At first I thought the prospects were minimal for coverage in the US press on this to be minimal, but apparently Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown has other ideas.

Brown, the likely successor to Tony Blair as head of the Labour Party, shares with Blair an interest in mitigating climate change and the release of the Stern report tomorrow and its dire predictions--that climate change could bring about a global depression--is evidence of the desire to raise the profile of both the issue as well as the upcoming international UN climate change conference in Nairobi.

If the report isn't enough, apparently <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&sid=axK1JbtRwqIQ&refer=uk">Brown has enlisted former US Vice President Al Gore as an advisor on the issue</a>.  Bloomberg is reporting that the enlistment of Gore is an effort to bring the US back into global talks about the successor to the Kyoto Protocol.

It is unlikely that Gore's involvement as an advisor to the British Treasury will change attitudes in Washington, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/28/AR2006102800428.html">but many observers are speculating</a> that the issue will play a factor in the 2008 Presidential election--both John McCain and Hillary Clinton are proponents of mandatory CO2 caps.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Blagojevich Calls for Recycling of All State-Owned Electronic Waste</title>

According to the <a href="http://www.qctimes.net/articles/2006/10/30/news/business/doc4546df48eca6b365071695.txt">Quad-City Times</a>, Blagojevich wants the legislature to develop a comprehensive state-wide electronics waste recylcing bill in the spring.

It is amazing that there is not more stringent legislation on the disposal of electronic items, considering elements such as mercury and lead that are contained in computers and other consumer electronics.  A perennial problem has been the global trade in "e-waste" to the Global South where there is often a less stringent regulatory environment and despeerate economic conditions.  The <a href="http://svtc.etoxics.org/site/PageServer?pagename=homepage">Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition</a> has been doing good work exposing the hazards this trade in waste poses for people in the developing world.
The main treaty governing the trade in e-waste, <a href="http://www.basel.int/index.html">the Basel Convention</a>, has not been ratified by the United States. Therefore, when states want to process their e-waste responsibly, they have to develop individual state laws. <a href="http://www.cio.com/blog_view.html?CID=25951"> A recent study by the National Electronics Recycling Infrastructure Clearinghouse</a> has shown that there is an incredible amount of economic inefficiency and duplication that ensues due to the lack of federal coordination of the nation's e-waste.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Global Reaction to the Stern Report</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=42</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2006 01:30:34 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have mentioned a couple of times over the past week about the report officially issued yesterday by British economist Sir Nicholas Stern on the economic consequences of climate change.  Sir Nicholas was charged by Gordon Brown, Tony Blair's likely successor as leader of the Labour Party, to produce the study in advance of next week's UN meetings in Nairobi on climate change.

I thought it would be interesting to see some of the reaction globally to the report.  The British paper, The Independent, considers it quite portentous.  In an article entitled, <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/article1943294.ece">"The Day that Changed the Climate,"</a> the reporters portray the report's unveilling in dramatic terms:
<blockquote>Climate change has been made the world's biggest priority, with the publication of a stark report showing that the planet faces catastrophe unless urgent measures are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Future generations may come to regard the apocalyptic report by Sir Nicholas Stern, a former chief economist at the World Bank, as the turning point in combating global warming, or as the missed opportunity.</blockquote>
In the <a href="http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/20/529528">Ugandan paper, The New Vision, expatriate Opio Oloya</a> is using the report to suggest an African continental protocol to maintain and protect forested land.  He also suggests that a continental protocol could also deal with the unwanted dumping of hazardous waste.

India--like China--was one of the countries who was not required to reduce CO2 emissions under Kyoto and has, in the interim, seen significant economic growth and an expansion of fossil fuel consumption.  Naturally, many in India are not excited about what a post-Kyoto agreement will look like.  In the <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1061387">Mumbai Daily News and Analysis</a>, a pro-India commentator suggested:
<blockquote>“This is welcome report but we have to point out that India has already been doing a lot in managing climate change issues,” said Manoj Ladwa, MLS Chase India. “India is the 6th largest investor in renewable energy which is much larger than the UK,” he added. The USA emits 5 per cent of world’s emissions and unless they are ready to take the lead in curbing pollution there is no point in asking countries like India to get on board feel Indian analysts.

“India is in the top five of using solar energy, wind energy etc,” explained Ladwa. “It is very hard to ask a farmer in India who has just seen a glimmer of hope in economic development that they should now pay for the mess the west has created in the last 250 years,” he added.</blockquote>
One can understand India's position when you consider the reaction of some of the more skeptical Western governments.  In Australia, rather than changing the opinion of the government, the Stern report seems to have strengthened Prime Minister John Howard's opposition to Kyoto.  <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/howard-defiant-on-climate/2006/10/31/1162278142402.html">The Age is reporting</a> that he told his MPs not to be "mesmerized" by the report.  He is willing to sign on to a successor agreement; but only on the condition that India and China are also obligated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The Secretary-General of OPEC--the global oil cartel--had the most indignant response.  <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2006-10-31T101400Z_01_L31174050_RTRUKOC_0_US-ENVIRONMENT-STERN-OPEC.xml&WTmodLoc=IntNewsHome_C2_worldNews-3">Reuters is reporting </a>that the Secretary-General is stating that the report was unfounded in both economics and science.]]></content:encoded>

"Lifestyle Centers" are the big trend in suburban mall development.  Unlike the traditional shopping mall, with its closed interior, anchored by large department stores and surrounded by a sea of parking lots, the lifestyle center tries to mimic a "Main Street" feel by putting streets through the middle of the development in an attempt to create a "street culture" redolent of what one would find in a city.  Conceptually, they attempt to minimize the sterile quality of the mall through the provision of public space.  Below is a rendering of a planned lifestyle center in Pittsburgh:

<img src="http://www.walnutcapital.com/images/render07.jpg" />

They generally look interesting on paper, but once built, they are often awkward since the spaces are basically <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2116246/">undercover malls</a>.  Perhaps developers are using these models because consumers and suburbanites are sick of the homogeniety of the mall.  But oftentimes these clandestine attempts to hide the mall without fundamentally transforming it seem to come up short.

		<title>Sprawl-Obesity Link Questioned</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=45</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the last several years there have been numerous studies that suggest a linkage between the types of neighborhoods where people live and rates of obesity.  A whole subfield of <a href="http://www.activelivingresearch.org/index.php">"Active Living Research"</a> has emerged to understand the reasons why obesity has skyrocketed in recent years.  The idea that living in suburban areas might increase the likelihood to be obese is logical.  Generally North American suburbs are built and organized around facilitating automotive mobility at the expense of pedestrian mobility.  Since suburbanites are forced to drive everywhere they may not be getting as much exercise as people dwelling in a more density-rich environment.

<a href="http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/healthreport.html">Smart Growth America published a report in 2003</a> that suggested people living in counties with a higher sprawl index had higher problems with obesity.  They linked census data on sprawl with national health data from the CDC's <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/">Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System</a> to substantiate their claims.

Their findings were not without controversy. The <a href="http://www.canada.com/topics/bodyandhealth/story.html?id=e3932c7a-0a97-4b94-8fcd-1516ea86cfe1&k=17723&p=1">Ottawa Citizen is reporting</a> on a new study questioning these claims.  A team led by University of Toronto economist <a href="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~mturner/research.htm">Matthew Turner</a> have written a <a href="http://diegopuga.org/research/fatcity.pdf">paper</a> [pdf] suggesting the absence of a link between sprawl and obesity.  Unlike the Smart Growth America study, Turner's research stems from a longitudinal health data set following the same people from 1988-1994.  With this data, Turner and his colleagues had the luxury of seeing changes in body mass index in specific people as they moved to different environments.  Their analysis indicates that there is no relationship between changes in BMI and sprawl.

The study is still a "working paper," meaning that it has not gone through the standard process of peer review.  But, nevertheless, the preliminary results are undoubtedly provocative and will probably be scruitinized by the many scholars who have been arguing the opposite for the last several years.]]></content:encoded>

The US signed the Kyoto agreement during Clinton's presidency, but Congress never ratified the treaty.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Eizenstat argues that one of the ways to get buy-in from the US in the next round of global climate change discussions—which start next week in Nairobi—is to focus on bringing in forest projects more forcefully to any future greenhouse gas mitigation scheme.  Reforestation and afforestation projects increase the planet's carbon assimilation capacity.  Deforestation—which has been a serious problem in certain developing countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia—minimizes carbon assimilation, making CO2 emissions even more problematic.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Under international agreements in the 1990s, there was a movement to establish Clean Development Mechanisms, whereby investment from Europe and the United States would be concentrated on environmentally-friendly projects in the Global South.  The issue of whether developed countries could get credit for their own emissions by investing in forestation projects in the Global South was embraced by Kyoto, but it was not a central component of the treaty.  Large countries like the US & Russia argued that they should be allowed more CO2 emissions because they have large undeveloped forested areas that act as carbon sinks.  Other countries rejected this, saying that reduction in actual emissions should be the focus of the treaty.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Eizenstat argues that awarding more significance for both the funding of forest projects and the presence of pre-existing forest land might help sway the US to support post-Kyoto agreements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US Congressional Election and Sustainability Issues</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night's Congressional elections were pretty dramatic.  As of this writing, the Democrats have picked up <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/elections/2006/House.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1163028918-OCz/JJ8wgRP0WTiBOp25bA">28 seats in the House</a> and are <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/08/AR2006110801435.html">probably going to win a majority in the Senate</a>.

While the election was largely a referendum on Bush's failed war in Iraq and the lack of a Republican-controlled Congress to maintain adequate oversight over the executive branch, there may be spaces for change in environmental policy at the federal level.

The environmental blog, Grist, has a <a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2006/11/8/101227/371">good rundown </a>of how environmentally-friendly candidates fared (pretty well) as well as those more antagonistic to environmental concerns (pretty poorly).

Environmental issues did not figure prominently in many campaigns, although some new Democratic members--who the pundits kept on pointing out on the television coverage were allegedly more "conservative" than many of their partisan counterparts--have expressed an interest in envrionmental legislation.

Senator-elect Bob Casey from Pennsylvania, for instance, <a href="http://election2006.blogs.pennlive.com/default.asp?item=268917">supports mandatory limits on CO2 emissions</a>.  Others, like Claire McCaskill of Missouri have <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/politics/15916330.htm">been less forthcoming</a> about specific policies they may support on the issue.

On the global front, <a href="http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=289381&area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__international_news/">representatives of NGOs attending the climate change talks in Nairobi were largely upbeat</a> about the change in party control.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The big news from the UN climate change discussions in Kenya yesterday was <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003375873_trees09.html">the announcement by</a> the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Wangari Maathai, that she would lead a global voluntary initiative to plant a billion trees worldwide in the next year.  Trees, of course, absorb CO2 gases which can offset human-derived carbon emissions.  The <a href="http://www.unep.org/billiontreecampaign/">United Nations Environment Programme has set up a website</a> where you can pledge to plant a tree over the next year.

At side events in Nairobi, many scientists are presenting research relating to the effects of climate change and the effectiveness of mitigation measures.  <a href="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7005463942">Scientists in Germany are expressing caution</a> at relying on ocean sequestration techniques for CO2.  <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/news/archive/2006/11/09/international/i104331S54.DTL">Others are saying</a> that oceans are becoming more acidic as a a result of climate change.
There are also debates surrounding the political nature of global climate change talks, with many representatives of the Global South <a href="http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news.php?articleid=1143960906">arguing for equity</a> in global policies.

Several conference participants are providing first-hand accounts of what is happening in Kenya this week, including <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/005284.html">representatives of the Washington, DC think tank</a> World Resources Institute and <a href="http://nightingalesangatwcc.typepad.com/kenya/2006/11/the_articles_ar.html">representatives of the British relief group</a>, Christian Aid.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://unfccc.int/files/inc/graphics/image/pjpeg/cop_12_logo_150.jpg" />For those of us unable to make the trip to Nairobi for the UN Climate Change Conference, the <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_12/items/3754.php">website for the conference</a> offers a wealth of information.  Particularly of interest are the <a href="http://www.un.org/webcast/unfccc/archive.asp">webcasts</a> of the various presentations at the conference.  There is material ranging from formal sessions to research from the "side events" to short discussions from non-profits and activists.

It will be interesting to keep tabs on the site as higher-level government officials from throughout the world descend on Nairobi for the more intense talks that begin next week.

<a href="http://www.davidmiliband.defra.gov.uk/blogs/ministerial_blog/default.aspx">David Miliband</a>, the British environmental minister, is <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/green/story/0,,1945119,00.html">heading to Kenya this weekend</a> for the talks and will likely have a high-profile role.  He will be <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/podcasts/">participating in a daily podcast</a> for the Guardian beginning on Monday.

In Canada, domestic political debate is heating up prior to the talks.  The minority government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper recently <a href="http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=d599aea5-14d7-488c-b569-e61a19c7a774&k=10000">released a climate change plan that many critics feel is weak</a>.  It doesn't require any significant emission cuts until 2050!

All of the Canadian opposition parties are against Harper's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and <a href="http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Canada/2006/11/10/2301422-sun.html">all will be sending representatives to Nairobi</a> to "shadow" Tory environmental minister Rona Ambrose.  Late last month NDP leader, Jack Layton, nearly <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061031/layton_greenplan_061031/20061031?hub=CTVNewsAt11">threatened to bring down Harper's government</a> over the issue.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ontario is having municipal elections on Monday and one of the main issues facing candidates in the Toronto suburban "905" area is how to deal with the suburban sprawl that is engulfing Ontario's countryside.  It has been over a year since the province has passed its Places to Grow and Greenbelt Acts which are designed both to protect open space and guide development.  These acts have potential to coordinate development, although it is too soon to judge their effectiveness.

One major variable is whether municipalities on Toronto's exurban fringe abide by provincial plans.  This is quite an open question, particularly since developers have traditionally had strong influence insuburban government.  Robert MacDermid of York University has done <a href="http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2006/MacDermid.pdf">research [.pdf]</a> showing how developers are the major donors for municipal candidates.

<a href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1162034471533&call_pageid=968332188492&col=968793972154&t=TS_Home">The Toronto Star has a report on a group of candidates</a> who are bucking the trend by refusing developers' money. The article includes a list of challengers and incumbents who reject developers' dollars.  It will be interesting to see if some of these candidates are able to defeat better-funded opponents on thier independent platforms.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Landscape Architecture and Chinese Urbanization</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently <a href="http://www.landscapecn.com/paper/detail.asp?id=2473">came across an interesting article on urbanization in China</a> and the promise of environmentally-sensitive urban planning as the world's most populous country also becomes the world's most <em>urban</em>.

Written by Kongjian Yu who is Dean of Landscape Architecture at Peking University and the founder of the design firm <a href="http://www.turenscape.com/english/index.asp">Turenscape</a>, the article gives an insightful background into the challenges of urbanization in China.  The article is geared towards critiquing the landscape architecture profession in China, which Kongjian thinks is preoccupied with the traitional small scale garden.

In its stead, Kongjian advocates an emphasis on ecological planning models which require a more expansive vision and a balancing of culture, economic growth, and ecological concerns.  The sum of his argument seems to position landscape architecture as a practical way of dealing with the intense rates of growth in China's cities.

It seems to be a compelling vision and is indicative of the vibrancy of the debates in China happening around environmental and urbanization issues.  As opposed to the monolithic picture of China presented in the Western media, Kongjian's piece shows how environmentalism and urbanization are becoming spaces for assertive questioning of existing policies.]]></content:encoded>

Boxer's leadership on this issue stands in stark contrast to the current chair--James Inhofe of Oklahoma--who actually denies the existence of climate change and was infamously turned the Senate committee into a joke by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/29/books/29cric.html?ex=1285646400&en=34deb5f18e2b9858&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">calling on a science fiction novelist </a>to testify at one of the committee's hearings on environmental policy.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've read about Celebration before, and I was pretty off-put by a town where all aspects of public life (including local government, stores, and schools) were owned by a corporation. Additionally, New Urbanism as I understood it was about re-creating New England small-town dynamics in planned communities. Celebration from what I read just seems like an ultra-suburb for even more segregated white people who are OK with Disney Corp managing each aspect of their lives. The author of the book went to Celebration and heard people complain about how the po-mo ironic columns in their multi-story homes blocked them from opening their car doors in their driveways. Yeah, sounds like awesome planning.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[That's a good point, Vadim.  New Urbanists themselves debate on whether Celebration is actually a New Urbanist community.

In fact many of the larger New Urbanist developments have been on the suburban fringe.  This is primarily due to the fact that housing development in the US is market-based.  These developments cost big bucks and, hence, developers are seeking to maximize thier bottom line by purchasing cheap agricultural land for development.

Celebration is a little different since Disney owned the land since the 1960s.  It is located in suburban hell, however.  The main problem is that New Urbanist concepts are micro-level responses to what are essentially macro, regional issues of development. In that sense, the New Urbanism is bound to be ineffectual.

I've taken on some of the issues of civic engagement in Celebration in an article I published in Contemporary Justice Review [Dec2004, Vol. 7 Issue 4, p.375-393]: "The magic kingdom syndrome: trials and tribulations of life in Disney's celebration."

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've just written a reaction paper on your  "The Magic Kingdom Syndrome: Trials and Tribulation of Life in Disney's Celebration" for my Urban Community course. I wonder whether you could give me some feedback? Thanks very much.

“Celebration” a new town built and managed by Walt Disney Corporation is a planned or artificial town/community. Disney as a profit-making enterprise is primarily responsible for its investors whose onerous concern is the return or simply, profit. The objective of developing “Celebration” is firstly to expand the business base from physical and virtual entertainment to property development, and secondly to build an even better image to enhance later profit opportunities.
“Celebration” is built on an image of friendly, family-oriented, entertaining yet educational, healthy and with strong environmental and social ethos. Its concept is to attract (home) buyers from the educated middle class who happen are also the core buyers of other Disney products. “The Magic Kingdom Syndrome: Trails and Tribulations of Life in Disney’s Celebration” of Huge Bartling is trying to explain why Celebration as a community fails because of the incompatibility of the commodity value and the community value. As Disney’s bottom line is to make Celebration profitable as a commodity, while a “human-based” community is a more complex entity than an exchangeable commodity; it just simply does not work. Conflict of ideals from both parties (residents and the corporation) emerged from the start: disillusions of residents expressed in the community papers, the rows on the invasion of outsiders, the enlargement of the town hotel, the school management and so on. At the end, both parties give in and give up their dreams: living in an ideal community for the residents and making a sustaining profit for the corporation. The residents have risen and failed their fight; they leave Celebration in disillusion and silence. The Corporation have tried to accommodate but could not maintain both profit and integrity of the original community concept. The conclusion is: Celebration fails as a community and the concept of “commodification of a community” has a long way to go.
As urbanization and technology progress, industrialization and enterprising emerge, and they lead to new forms of “exchange” sociologist call the process “commodification”. From exchange of food to goods and services, many inventions and discoveries emerge on the way, such as “paper money”, “market places”, banks, brokers, advertising and marketing to enhance such exchanges. One of the new tools among them is image making : beautifying a product or commodity beyond its core usage to stimulate greater desire or demand and bring in greater profitability.
Private housing development has been always a commodity in this sense but it normally confined to a unified restricted area and does not have jurisdictions over aspects beyond the physical territory such as education, public works, transit and health and so forth. The private developers rely on the good will of the local and regional government supplying these infrastructures and supports for their transactions completed and succeeded.
Success bleeds ambition and further expansion. For Disney, Celebration is the ideal showcase of their power in “creation of lifestyle and happiness” like all their films, theme parks and playgrounds. “Celebration” was designed as their ultimate “fantasy driven” test case as well as their biggest property development project embracing the “community” concept into their consumerism philosophy. They promote Celebration as a dream (utopian) community where people meet, work and play in a safe and secluded environmental friendly place; indirectly projecting a middle class status image: well-to-do, educated and have potential or aspirations to power and success. If Celebration succeeds, it could potentially open up a new business model for Disney to draw in bigger profit and to extend its corporate ambition.
In a crowded industrialized and competitive urban society, people long to re-establish their roots with the nature and their neighbours. They dream and live to fulfil the new “utopian” world – the “new wave” community life that comprises of new technology, conveniences, comfort and traditional community’s face-to-face environment. For a long time, property developers have utilized this middle class image with helps from other profession such as architecture, engineering and government planning in their business ventures. They mix and dice all the middle class images, project and reinforce their psychological desires and inspirations into the physical form of housing. And in most cases, they succeed. I think the main reason is they (the developers) leave the people and the properties alone as soon as they have received their reward (the payment) and leave the municipal governments to sort out the intangible problems exist in a community. The fact that Celebration is a town or community has made the developer, Disney Corporation the de factal governor who needs to find ways to fulfil the needs of a community while he does not have the community management expertise or the intra-governmental support. Worse, it fails to create value or produce profits for the Disney Empire.
Despite the failure of Celebration, similar planned communities are being built. Close to home, Stapleton just outside Denver city centre in Colorado is a minority-friendly with a fast-growing homosexual community but until today it has not lived up to the designer, Peter Calthorpe, the “new urbanism”guru’s expectation. Its poor commuting system has failed many residents and deterred new comers. Outside China’s biggest city Shanghai is constructing nine towns each featuring one particular architectural style (Alien Satellites for Shanghai by Angelica Wiederhecker, Financial Time Jan 14, 2007). The developer, Songjiang calls this development “Shanghai: One City, Nine Towns”. The design of the homes in each town resembles the architectures of the town of origin, such as Georgian town houses in Thames Town (English), environmentally friendly and sparsely designed houses in Golden Orchid (Scandinavia), mini gothic German castles in a German town. Another huge planned community is “The World Islands” in Dubai where homes are built on manmade islands for the super riches. Again, all these artificial new towns are for specific clienteles, generally very rich. They are in deed extreme form of property developments and do not connote the spirit of a community as they do not encompass aspects of community living, such as government,  schooling, health facilities and provision,  public or cultural events and intimate relationships among its residents.
One important question: does a purely profitable planned community work? If we trace back all the knowledge and understanding of our existing communities and their characteristics, we find there are a few facts:
1.	They are naturally products of evolutions of land and people
2.	The people involve are bounded by common interests (such as public safety, schooling, economic growth and impartial governing etc are both self-interest and common interest) despite their difference in economic and social backgrounds
3.	The people come from diverse background but compatible with each other
4.	The people together form a power to overcome short and long term adversities, natural, political or economic
5.	Communities are sustainable and can survive for a long time in history
If we use these criteria to assess the validity of a community, most planned or designed in particular the commercial-driven towns are not and will not succeed to be “urban communities”. In short: urban communities cannot be commodified although there are scopes be modified. New urbanism devotees need to redefine and rethink their strategy.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hilda,  Thanks for your comment!

First, I would make sure that you spell my  name right in your paper!  (Hugh--as opposed to "Huge")

Secondly, I would suggest that you might want to theorize "community" a bit more explicitly.  I don't think I made the contention that "community failed" in Celebration.  In fact, I think I argue the exact opposite.  The main thrust of the piece is that "community" is a nebulous--and therefore, contested--term.

Disney used it primarily for marketing purposes while Celebration residents clearly have had a different vision for what constitutes "community."

I think it's important not to glorify and simplify "community."  In this regard, it might be useful for you to look at Robert Bellah's "Habits of the Heart" as well as the late Iris Marion Young's essay in Linda Nicholson's "Feminism/Postmodernism."

I also looked more explicitly at the issue of community in Celebration  in a paper published a while back in the "Florida Historical Quarterly" ['Disney's Celebration, the Promise of New Urbanism, and the Portents of Homogeneity' Vol. 81, No. 1, 2002]

Good luck!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From the <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/travel/132923,TRA-news-ski12.article">Chicago Sun Times travel section</a>, there is a short mention about how ski resorts in the United States are concerned about global warming and have taken to both <a href="http://www.ecotourismblog.com/entry/smog-free-air-for-skiers-in-this-winter/">using renewable energy</a> and to <a href="http://site.pangaya.com/blog/2006/11/03/sustainable-slopes/">highlighting their "sustainability."</a>

However, these efforts seem more like marketing rather than indicative of a substantive change in behavior. <a href="http://irs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/33/4/367">Downhill skiing relies upon deforestation, the intensive use of water (and energy) for snowmaking</a>, as well as fossil fuel-intensive transportation networks for getting people to the slopes.   All of these elements contribute in particular ways to problems associated with climate change.
Downhill ski resorts are essentially examples of an industrial model of tourism, hooked into global flows of captial and markets.  Whether this industry can be balanced with "sustainable" practices is questionable.  Earlier this year, <a href="http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2006/02/07/shaw/">the website Grist, did an informative story</a> looking at dilemma facing the ski industry.]]></content:encoded>

This should bode well for the provincial efforts of the last year or so which call on municipalities to concentrate growth in particular areas while preserving green space.  There was a tendency amongst some of the politicos in the "905" suburbs to be skeptical of provincial motives.  With more sympatetic local politicans, there may be more acceptance of the proivincial restrictions in the name of regional planning.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Inhofe&#039;s Flack Gets Shouted Down at Climate Change Conference</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had mentioned a <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=53">couple of days ago</a> that one of the significant results from last week's Congressional election in the US was that Barbara Boxer will be replacing James Inhofe as the chair of the major Senate environmental committee.

One of the likely casualties of this transition will be Mark Morano, the Committee's current spokesman.  He cut <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/6/27/205932/076">his teeth working as a producer</a> for the right-wing talk show host, Rush Limbaugh before being appointed as Inhofe's propagandist.  In this latter role, he has <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/07/the-not-just-in-copenhagen-consensus/">focused his time on manufacturing non-existent "controversy"</a> over the existence of anthropogenic factors in climate change.

It seems that he is not willing to go down quietly in anticipation of the partisan swing in the Senate.  Earlier today, Morano attended the UN Climate Change Conference in Nairobi as a <a href="http://www.cicero.uio.no/webnews.asp?id=10726&lang=en">participant on a panel convened</a> by the Oslo-based Center for International Climate and Environmental Research on "Communicating Climate Change."  <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/14/africa/AF_GEN_Climate_Conference.php">Morano apparently shilled his "climate change skepticism" line</a> and was roundly dismissed by fellow panelists and audience members.

Luckily Morano will be likely be off the government payroll--or at least his position will be diminished--come January.  But one wonders about the wisdom, or even the purpose, of sending him on the taxpayers dime to Nairobi to talk nonsense on behalf of the Congress.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Just a quick note to lett you know that your blog is included in a recent post on my blog.

I have just put up a post with a series of links to the best blogs that i have found covering the Nairobi climate talks.

http://climatechangeaction.blogspot.com/2006/11/blogs-onfrom-unfccc-cop12-mop2-talks.html

I think some of these may be of interest. If you have any additions then let me know and I will append them.

It is my intention that this post serves as a hub for blog coverage of the talks, if you would like to link to the post that would be great. Many of these blogs are new and therefore difficult to find through technorati/google blog search,  and I think there is some value in highlighting blogs that are from rather than mearly about the events unfolding.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Senator Barbara Boxer of California led a group of colleagues who will be key senatorial committee chairs in the next US Congress <a href="http://boxer.senate.gov/news/releases/record.cfm?id=265906">in formulating a letter</a> to President Bush asking him to work with them on climate change legislation.

There is little specificity in the letter in terms of what any proposed legislation might look like, but in the past all three senators have supported manditory emission limits.  Some environmentalists are seeing the fact that the top Bush Administration official at the Nairobi conference, Undersecretary of State Paula Dobriansky, did not automatically reject the idea of mandatory limits in an <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/16/africa/AF_GEN_Kenya_Climate_Conference.php">interview yesterday</a> as a positive step.

In the interim, the somewhat unstable outgoing chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Jim Inhofe, is not leaving quietly.  In a press conference today he said that the United Nations is using the <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N16483379.htm">climate change conference to "brainwash"</a> kids.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Canada is on the receiving end of criticism this week at the UN Climate Change Conference in Nairobi for its waffling on the country's Kyoto committments.  Before she left for Nairobi Tory Environment Minister Rona Ambrose <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061115/ambrose_reality_check_061115/20061116/">appeared to be equivocating on CTV</a>, claiming that the country was "on track to meet all of our obligations under the Kyoto protocol but not the target."

Things didn't get much better when she arrived in Kenya.  <a href="http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/News/International/2006/11/16/2378058-sun.html">After Kofi Anan's speech yesterday decrying the "frightening lack of leadership"</a> to address the issue of emission reductions, critics started to speculate that the Canadians were among those implicated by the Secretary General.

The French Envrionment Minister, Nelly Olin, for example, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2006/11/16/kyoto-ambrose.html">expressed disappointment at the Canadian government's</a> likely retreat from Kyoto.  Activists at the conference associated with the Climate Action Network <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/WAL644654.htm">awarded Canada the "top fossil"</a> at the Nairobi talks.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Implementing Emissions Reduction in California</title>

When Governor Schwarzenegger announced in August that the state would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by the year 2020, little specificity was given to how such a goal would be achieved.

According to the article, the legislature has given the <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/homepage.htm">California Air Resources Board</a> wide latitutde in developing a strategy.  The state will likely have an emissions trading scheme similar to ones in the northeastern US, the EU, and the voluntary Chicago Climate Exchange.

However, the efficacy of emissions trading--which normally caps emissions for large industries--is questionable in the long run given the fact that 41% of California's emissions stem from transportation.  In the <a href="http://www.theday.com/re.aspx?re=5b87ee9e-87d2-4c45-9809-9341fbf5f914">EU the percentage is smaller--28%--but rising</a>.

Much of this has to do with a historic failure to address the problems with dominant land use policy that requires extensive automobile travel. It will be interesting to see if California winds up taking on the problem of regional planning as they figure out how to implement policies to reach their ambitious goal.]]></content:encoded>

The tax will be levied on electricity consumption beginning in April and extending to March, 2013.  Revenues will be used by the city's Office of Environmental Affairs to pay for implementing the city's ambitious <a href="http://www.ci.boulder.co.us/files/Environmental%20Affairs/climate%20and%20energy/cap_final_25sept06.pdf">Climate Action Plan</a> [.pdf], which was approved by the city council following the passage of a resolution in 2002 indicating the community's interest in meeting greenhouse gas emission targets laid out in the Kyoto Protocol.
The plan focuses on three main areas: improving energy efficiency, increasing the use of renewable energy, and reducing the amount of greenhouse gases stemming from transportation.  The Climate Action Plan is quite detailed and the fact that there is a funded mandate for implementation suggests that the community is serious about reducing emissions.  Boulder will undoubtedly be closely watched by other municipalities in the US--especially those that have signed on to the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/mayor/climate/">US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement</a> and the participants in last week's <a href="http://www.sundancesummit.com/index.html">mayors conference on climate change in Sundance, Utah</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Sustainability at Wal-Mart</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nwanews.com/adg/Business/173497/">Arkansas Democrat Gazette published a story on Sunday</a> looking at Wal-Mart's efforts to become more "green" by highlighting its <a href="http://walmartstores.com/Aurora/index.html">"experiemental store" in Aurora, Colorado</a>.

The store has many features associated with green design: on-site solar & wind energy, efficiency in lighting and climate control, xeriscaping, and intensive recycling efforts.  These are all admirable and likely to save the company money--but to herald Wal-Mart as a standard-bearer of sustainability is bit premature.

The Aurora store is still massively sized, built near an interstate highway, and still relies on global supply chains for virtually all of its merchandise.

Wal-Mart's efforts seem to be a clear example of "greenwashing."  While <a href="http://sev.prnewswire.com/retail/20061113/DAM02613112006-1.html">the company's press releases</a> tout that the Aurora store--along with another experimental store in McKinnney, Texas--is being evaluated by government-supported National Renewable Energy Laboratory, it is important to note the there already exists an <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19">extensive rating system for green building developed by the US Green Building Council</a>.  The LEED system has some shortcomings, to be sure.  But if Wal-Mart really wants to develop a green building, it would have much more legitimacy if it strived for one of the LEED designations.

Additionally, as the largest retailer in the US, the company could do much more on the purchasing end--especially by cultivating local manufacturers and requiring their overseas suppliers to meet basic environmental and labor standards.  The company has a <a href="http://southeastfarmpress.com/news/101906-walmart-sustainability/">demonstrated</a> <a href="http://www.lawnandlandscape.com/news/news.asp?ID=4898">record</a> of environmentally-problematic purchasing.

The could also do a better job at site selection by retrofitting existing buildings, favoring infill rather than <a href="http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17462930&BRD=2235&PAG=461&dept_id=439676&rfi=6">rezoned agricultural land</a>, and stop their <a href="http://www.sheboygan-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061109/SHE0101/611090556/1973">practice of constructing "throwaway buildings"</a> which are abandoned after a short period of time.

It would have been <a href="http://blogs.business2.com/greenwombat/2006/10/walmart_a_jolly.html">interesting</a> to see <a href="http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061028/NEWS/610280361/1002/NEWS01">the recent exchange</a> between environmental author Bill McKibben and a Wal-Mart Vice Presdient at last month's Society of Environmental Journalists conference in Vermont.  Apparently, McKibben offered some trenchant critique of the company.  His <a href="http://www.vermontwalmartwatch.org/box_store_alternatives.html">compatriots in Vermont have come up with</a> interesting alternatives to Wal-Mart's "big box" design that could be a different model for sustainability than the one currently being pursued by the company.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'd like to play devils advocate here just for a minute...

Wal-Mart does a lot of things (and I mean a lot) that I do not agree with, but to simply say that Wal-Mart’s attempts at becoming more eco-friendly is a clear example of greenwashing, well I can't say that I fully I agree. It could very well be my naivety and belief that people are inherently good... and that even corporations can want to do good in this world, but I really don't think that the attempts they are making should be knocked. Large companies taking these steps, even baby steps as they may be have the potential to make a huge impact in their communities or around the world.

While I am not typically a Wal-Mart shopper, I was in one yesterday because there isn’t a whole lot going on in this town my dad lives in - in Maine. I needed socks, so off to Wal-Mart we went and as I was looking at socks I noticed Organic ones! I knew of Wal-Mart’s attempts to introduce Organic food into their markets, but I had no idea they were also looking into Organic clothing.

Currently Nike is the largest purchaser of Organic cotton, I got this quote from their website “Our best estimates for 2003 show that more than 2.5 percent of the cotton we used globally was organic, representing approximately 3,000,000 pounds of organic cotton fiber; this figure makes Nike the largest retail user of organic cotton in the world (according to the Organic Exchange)” So, while the environmentally friendly folks out there might scoff and snicker at Nike wanting to use 2-5% Organic cotton by 2010 – its a lot more than ANYONE else is doing, until possibly now with Wal-Mart joining the cause. The items I saw were packaged as “Organic” Meaning that 95% or more of the cotton must be certified as Organic to have the word organic appear on the front of the package, while Nikes small percentage only allows them to list organic cotton on the items label.

Wal-Mart may very well currently recycle more than anyone, they might start composting more than anyone, they offering organic food and organic clothing, they’re seeking out green alternatives in their building practices, they offer one stop shopping –which ultimately cuts down on fuel consumption by consumers.

Is Wal-Mart doing these things because it’s what’s in right now?  Yea, I’m sure there is market motivation behind a lot of it, but as someone who does care about the environment I think its important that we do acknowledge the benefit that these small steps can make, both in communities and in the actions of other businesses – I mean many people believe that Wal-Mart and Conventional grocers are picking up natural foods to compete with Natural and Organic retailers and this is probably true, a few natural stores even have some green design integrated into their buildings…but, realize that in the true spirit of capitalism these companies big and small  will keep trying to “out do” each other while people are still concerned with sustainability and I don’t think that peoples purchasing habits leaning towards “products with a cause” or “more sustainable products” will change anytime soon. With that said, I do I think that Wal-Mart will continue to make progress and that consumers and corporations and the environment will all benefit from their changes.

I do agree that they should try to get LEED certified, and that they should go local – I guess the biggest problem for Wal-Mart is their purchasing as all of their items are all the same in all of their stores for price and efficiency purposes, but maybe going local at least partially is down the road a couple years – One of the things that has made Wal-Mart so wildly successful is their ability to adapt and change over time – Wal-Mart does listen to consumers and activists and whoever else is talking – so who is to say that Wal-Mart can’t or won’t keep on experimenting with becoming more sustainable? I personally think people should write to Wal-Mart and tell them they want “green Wal-Marts”  in their communities because the fact of the Matter is that Wal-Mart is not going away anytime soon, so they should be encouraged to keep doing good stuff, not torn apart because of it. Think about this… even if they didn’t do green design… how many customers do you think they’d lose? Probably none…

There is also a great article by the President of Seventh Generation and his experience with Wal-Mart, if all of my jibber jabber hasn’t already completely bored you: http://www.seventhgeneration.com/printpage_news.php?t=ntt_article&amp;id=462

Enjoy!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[European Union environment commissioner, <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/6e6e6dfc-902d-11db-8a42-0000779e2340.html">Stavros Dimas announced today that EU commissioners have come to an agreement</a> to include the intra-European aviation industry in its cap-and-trade emission scheme.

Under the proposal, the EU executive will determine the number of emissions credits available for European airlines.  Approximately 90% of the total will be given to airlines with the additional 10% offered in an auction.  If airlines are able to voluntarily reduce their emissions to levels less than than their credits, the surpluses can be sold to other industries currently participating in the EU-wide trading scheme set up to meet Kyoto reduction targets.

The aviation proposal still needs approval from member states before going into effect in 2011.  The current proposal avoids requiring flights from non-EU carriers flying into Europe to participate in the scheme until 2012.

Some <a href="http://www.transportenvironment.org/Article337.html">environmentalists argue that the scheme represents a windfall to the aviation industry</a>, since they do not have to purchase the initial credits and can sell them to other polluting industries.   Furthermore, some <a href="http://www.financialexpress-bd.com/index3.asp?cnd=12/21/2006&section_id=4&newsid=47294&spcl=no">European airlines are already making changes to reduce their emissions voluntarily</a>.

Other critics allege that <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/News/20Dec2006_news19.php">the aviation industry is less of a polluter than others</a> and should not be singled out for emissions regulation.  This, however, ignores the significant problem with aviation emissions--<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/biztravel/2006-12-18-jet-pollution-usat_x.htm?POE=NEWISVA">not only do they affect greater damage because of the altitude where emissions take place</a>, carbon emissions from aviation are also <a href="http://www.rte.ie/business/2006/1220/airlines.html">dramatically increasing </a>in Europe.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/business/21pollute.html?ex=1324357200&en=3cc5d8ea0bf8a0c9&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">New York Times has a front page story today</a> on some of the challenges stemming from the United Nations' <a href="http://cdm.unfccc.int/">Clean Development Mechanism</a> scheme.

CDMs are CO2 emission mitigation projects in "less developed" countries, like China and Brazil, that are financed by "developed" countries in Europe and Asia as part of the Kyoto Protocol.  The main idea behind the scheme is that developed countries can earn credits towards their emission reduction targets by paying for projects in the developing world, where governments and businesses have less surplus capital to invest in mitigation.

The article asserts that many of the CDM projects have been concentrated in Chinese factories designed to minimize the emissions associated with producing artificial refrigerants used in air conditioners.  Ironically, these same refirgerants are responsible for another serious global environmental problem: ozone depeletion.  Thus, the CDMs--while making the emissions regime more efficient--are having the secondary effect of exacerbating ozone depletion.  Analysts quoted in the article speculate that much of the reason for the concentration of money in CDMs is the high return on investment.

The article raises many interesting questions relating to market-based schemes for dealing with environmental issues.  Furthermore, it reflects the long-standing bias at the international level for concentrating development aid in large projects, rather than ones at a small scale.  From the standpoint of the CDMs, <a href="http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/MapApp">a look at the map where the certified emission reduction projects are located</a> shows that more industrialized countries, like China, Brazil and India are the beneficiaries of "clean development" investment.

Areas in sub-Saharan Africa --on the other hand--are receiving very little CDM investment, largely due to the fact that more small-scale mitigation efforts that would be appropriate in the regional context are less likely to attract market interest.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US Population Growth and the Future of Cities</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The syndacated columnist <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/outlook/4408940.html">Neal Peirce recently reported</a> on an <a href="http://www.uli.org/">Urban Land Institute</a> forum held in Washington that brought together experts on urbanism to discuss how metropolitan regions in the US should prepare for the significant rates of population gorwth expected in the next several decades.

If any conclusions were drawn at the forum, Peirce suggests that the major one would be an expectation for the continued rise of the megalopolis.  To the extent that the fragmented nature of land use policy and the lack of regional planning are entrenched in US political culture, this seems to be a reasonable prediction.  Settlement patterns will likely follow the "spider-like" corridors defined by interstate highways, so the type of large metropolitan mass one sees between Washington DC & New York, or Los Angeles and San Diego, will be replicated in other areas of the country--particularly in the Sunbelt.

One interesting comment Peirce makes is that many forum participants sense a reinvigorated federal role in metropolitan development.  The feds control enough infrastructure dollars that they can certainly dictate that financing be used in a more sustainable fashion.

It will be interesting to see how the Democratic Congress asserts itself in this regard, with strong sustainability  and urban advocates like <a href="http://blumenauer.house.gov/">Earl Blumenauer</a> having greater power.

Change, of course, does not come without conflict.  The Urban Land Institute is already <a href="http://thegroundfloor.typepad.com/the_ground_floor/2006/12/smart_growth_sh.html#trackback">responding to simplistic critiques</a> of Peirce's favorable column.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>China&#039;s Development Powered by Illegal Mines</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=70</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://hughbartling.blogspot.com/2006/12/illegal-power-plants-coal-mines-in.html">Wall Street Journal has an insightful article today</a> on the proliferation of illegal power generation plants and coal mines in the interior regions of China.

While the country's centralized government tries to manage the factors of economic development, the sheer size of the country and relative autonomy of local officials allows for signifcant transgressions to official policy.  Central to China's growth over the past decade, or so, has been the expansion of industrial production facilities and the increasing levels of consumption of the country's growing urban populations as China's economic focus moves from agriculture to manufacturing.

Manufacturing, of course, requires energy and China's main source of fossil fuels comes from its large coal deposits.  Given the rising demand for energy and China's importance in the global marketplace, levels of coal consumption have dramatically increased in recent years.

This has posed a challenge for the Chinese government.  <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2006-11/02/content_723855.htm">As demand increases</a>, the ability to regulate becomes more problematic and CO2 emissions, foul air, and unsafe working conditions in mines proliferate.

There are no simple policy remedies for reining in these illegal mines and power plants given the fact that they are essential elements fuelling China's economic growth.  Nevertheless, the environmental and human consequences are significant and likely to cause both domestic and international problems for the Communist government.

The government is trying to resolve its environmental contradictions with some forward-thinking renewable energy projects, such as the <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/NEWS/Intl_Business/2_straw-burning_plants_in_China/articleshow/926714.cms">new biomass electricity plants opened in Jiangsu and Shangdong provinces</a> as well as <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/200612/26/eng20061226_336015.html">renewed calls</a> for more energy efficiency.  Whether these gestures can possibly reduce the country's coal dependency in the long run is doubtful.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bush Administration Limping Towards Recognizing Problems With Global Warming</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday was the deadline for the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/26/AR2006122601034.html">US Department of Interior to respond</a> to a law suit waged against them last year by a coalition of environmental NGOs led by the <a href="http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/swcbd/">Center for Biological Diversity</a>.  At issue in the suit was the administration's failure to list the arctic-dwelling polar bear as a  threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.

Various environmental and scientific groups have argued that the fundamental transformations in the circumpolar arctic climate have contributed to dwindling populations of polar bears.  A particular problem is the melting of ice over which the bears travel to find food.  As the ice melts, the populations find the process of procuring food more difficult which contributes to stress and high levels of mortality.

The suit required the US Fish and Wildlife Service to respond to petitions for listing the polar bear as a threatened species, and <a href="http://alaska.fws.gov/fisheries/mmm/polarbear/pdf/polar_bear.pdf">yesterday's report</a> [.pdf] acknowledges the validity of the polar bear's threatened status.

What is significant in the report is the half-hearted acknowledgment that climate change is a factor in the polar bear's demise.  Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne was a bit evasive on this issue even in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence.  In a <a href="http://hughbartling.blogspot.com/2006/12/us-secretary-of-interior-press.html">news conference yesterday</a>, Kempthorne both acknowledged that climate change is a factor in the destruction of polar bear habitats, but also claimed that addressing that issue was outside of the mandate of species protection under the Endangered Species Act.  Here is an excerpt from the press conference:
<blockquote>QUESTION: Thanks very much.  Secretary, thank you.

In your opening remarks, you pointed out very clearly that the melting sea ice was the cause of this loss of habitat.

And I think you also said, if I remember what you said correctly, that the administration treats climate change very seriously and recognizes the role of greenhouse gases.

In those circumstances, under the 1973 act, is the administration now obligated to act to curb the omission of greenhouse gases? And, if not, why not?

<strong>KEMPTHORNE:</strong> After the -- and this was stated earlier -- with the Endangered Species Act -- and that's the element that we're working with right now -- that whole aspect of climate change is beyond the scope of the Endangered Species Act.

Now, as also has been pointed out, with President Bush, with his administration -- where there's been an investment of $29 billion dealing with this issue of climate change.

So in a different venue, there will continue to be discussions, identification of the science, discussions as to what efforts can be done.

But we're actually seeing that there has been some reductions here in the United States, so we're going to continue that effort.

But that is outside the scope of this.

What we're talking about right now with the Endangered Species Act is one species, a polar bear.

And during the next 12 months, it will be an evaluation of that animal, what is happening to its habitat and what sort of mitigations could be brought forward that could be of help to that species.

QUESTION: Thanks so much.

If I may follow up, if you're saying the act obliges you to trying to protect the habitat, and you're also admitting that the administration sees a link between climate change and greenhouse gases: Why are you not, therefore, legally obliged to try and deal with those greenhouse gases?

<strong>KEMPTHORNE:</strong> Well, again, it's not part of the Endangered Species Act.</blockquote>
Other <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/environment/july-dec06/bear_12-27.html">commentators see this as much more significant</a> than Kempthorne.  Andrew Wetzler of the <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/">Natural Resources Defence Council</a> suggests that if the polar bear is indeed listed as an Endangered Species, then the federal government will have to develop a recovery plan which would necessarily have to deal with climate change.

Over the next year, the Department of Interior will continue to study the issue and will allow for a period of public comment before the polar bear is officially designated as threatened.  According to the <a href="http://alaska.fws.gov/fisheries/mmm/polarbear/issues.htm">Fish and Wildlife website</a> dealing with polar bear conservation, the 90 day period for public commentary will likely begin on 11 January 2007.]]></content:encoded>

The "middle stance" is represented by commentators who acknowledge that antrhopogenic factors exist, but that the debate should be centered around assessing levels of risk.

Rather than being something new, as portrayed in the article, this "middle stance" is better described as the long-standing skepticism inherent in the scientific project that guides both policy analysis and the "hard science" of climatological research.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday <a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1070101/asp/nation/story_7206375.asp">marked the completion of the Sardar Sarovar Dam</a> on India's Narmada River.

The erection of this dam and others in the Narmada valley have been the subject of intense political struggle in India and reflect the intense social and environmental tensions apparent as the country has embarked on a path towards urbanization and industrialization.  According to the <a href="http://www.sardarsarovardam.org/">dam administrator's website</a>, planning for this dam began in the late 1940s and has basically encountered consistent opposition--particularly from environmental and social justice groups.

From a social justice perspective, the dam is having significant impact on indigenous and farming communities who have either been displaced by the dam [<a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/SP136674.htm">a figure of  320,000 has been given by anti-dam activists</a>] or will no longer have access to fertile farmland.  Additionally, those who have been displaced have--in many cases--not been given compensation as required by law.  From an environmental perspective, there are many questions about <a href="http://www.indiatogether.org/2006/aug/soc-narmada.htm">how the dam will withstand India's perennial monsoon seasons</a> and the affects of <a href="http://www.ielrc.org/content/c8601.pdf">subsequent deforestation in the Narmada basin</a> will have on the changing hydrology.

The World Bank took the rare step of withdrawing financing of the project in the early 1990s due to the social, political, and environmental problems associated with the dam.

Over the years there have been numerous violent demonstrations, non-violent protests, and hunger strikes to stop the dam and to demand compensation to its victims.  Sardar Sarovar will undoubtedly generate more electricity to power India's growing economy, but it has been done at the expense of thousands of people whose way of life and culture will be irretrivable.

For more information on Sardar Sarovar, I would suggest looking at <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss19/ramachandra.shtml">this recent article in the Harvard Human Rights Journal</a> and <a href="http://www.patwardhan.com/films/narmadadiary.htm">Adnan Patwardhan's compelling film</a>, "A Narmada Diary."]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Canadian Environment Minister Sacked</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070105.wshuffle05/BNStory/National/home">shuffled his cabinet yesterday</a> with the biggest news being that Rona Ambrose is out as environment minister.  Ambrose is moving to the position of intergovernmental affairs minister while John Baird is leaving as president of the Treasury Board to take her place.

This represents a recognition by Harper that his political miscalculation of 2006 could come back to haunt him in elections anticipated for later this year.  Harper came into office leading a minority government and quickly put environmental concerns on the back burner.  He further exacerbated problems by pledging to step away from Canada's obligations under Kyoto and supporting a roundly-criticized "Clean Air Act" that would push off substantive emissions reduction until 2020.

This assult on climate change provisions occured at the same time as there emerged a wider recognition amongst the Canadian populace of the problems associated with climate change.  In the international arena, Canada came under fire during last November's UN climate change conference in Nairobi for backpedalling on Kyoto, causing embarassment at home.  The elevation of environmental concerns to a top priority in Canadian politics culminated in last month's election of former envrionment minister <a href="http://stephanedion.ca/?q=en/node">Stéphane Dion</a> as head of the opposition Liberal party.

Ambrose never had the political skill to adequately defend the Tory change in policy.  New environment minister, John Baird, was <a href="http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/story.html?id=5b7f6f3f-7c32-4d10-af37-9162da88934c">described yesterday</a> by Canadian pundits as more politically adept than Ambrose.  Whether Baird's appointment <a href="http://wwf.ca/Blog/SaveOurClimate/pivot/entry.php?id=46#body">will actually result in a shift in policy emphasis is unclear</a>.  What is clear is that if an election is called this  year climate change and environmental policy will figure as high-profile issues.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Friday, the <a href="http://environment.guardian.co.uk/travel/story/0,,1983334,00.html">Guaridan published excerpts of an interview</a> with UK environment minister Ian Pearson taking the global airline industry to task for resisting efforts to mitigate CO2 emissions produced by air travel.  The interview was notable for the vituperative tone taken by Pearson--especially towards the US airlines and Irish discount carrier, Ryan Air.

While passenger airline travel makes up a small proportion of global emissions, the per-capita emissions stemming from air travel are significant.  The Guardian article explains that the amount of CO2 emitted for a passenger flying round-trip from London to New York is equivalent to the amount emitted for a year's worth of home heating.

The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/world/europe/07cars.html?ex=1325826000&en=61c8512705243749&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">New York Times today highlights</a> another--probably bigger--problem facing Europe's carbon footprint: the proliferation of automobiles.  While Europe's central cities maintain the walkability of their medieval origins and have accomodated public transit adequately in many places, recently Europe's metropolitan regions have taken on more sprawling" forms of growth.  The Times article highlights the congestion in Dublin where suburban growth has not been accompanied by public transit development, requiring more people to drive to get to employment and shopping sites.

Certain places, like Denmark, have been successful in decreasing demand for automobiles by levying heavy taxes; but throughout other places in Europe, there has been less of a political committment to addressing this pressing issue.  In Britain, there may be fissures of change as <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/eddington_transport_study/eddington_index.cfm">last month's report on transport policy</a> for the Treasury by Sir Rod Eddington broached the idea of increasing taxes for automobile CO2 emissions.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bush: Reduce Gasoline Consumption by 20% by 2017</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=76</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It was widely speculated before his speech to Congress last night that Bush would try to lift his historically-low approval ratings by introducing significant initiatives relating to energy use, environmental protection, and global warming.

It is unclear how the speech will affect his approval ratings, but it would not be disingenuous to characterize the initiatives that he introduced last night as predictibly underwhelming.  Rather than calling for a cap and trade emissions programme that is argued for by many environmentalists and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/22/AR2007012201237.html">business leaders</a>, Bush wants to reduce gasoline consumption over the next decade primarily to "<a href="http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=politics&id=4965263">dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil</a>."

His main approach is extraordinarily short-sighted: <a href="http://www.farmfutures.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=CD26BEDECA4A4946A1283CC7786AEB5A&nm=News&type=news&mod=News&mid=9A02E3B96F2A415ABC72CB5F516B4C10&tier=3&nid=B38E3AE27187417B89D9E803B49C1B2D">wait for the hope of cellulosic ethanol</a> to join with traditional, corn-based ethanol as a replacement for gasoline.  As it stands now, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/22/AR2007012201306.html">these types of "alternative" fuels require both massive amounts of energy to produce, acres of farmland, as well as massive agricultural subsidies</a>.  Curiously, Bush didn't indicate whether or not he will push to drop <a href="http://www.farmfutures.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=CD26BEDECA4A4946A1283CC7786AEB5A&nm=News&type=news&mod=News&mid=9A02E3B96F2A415ABC72CB5F516B4C10&tier=3&nid=3D1AB058508A48F0A436A3A0ECA68B81">the tariff on imported ethanol</a>.  While importing ethanol would not "reduce our dependence on foreign oil," the fact that most of our current imports come from friendly and stable governments like Brazil and Costa Rica makes the national security argument untenable.
The glaring ommission in Bush's speech was any treatment of point-source pollution reduction stemming from power plants or industry.  This, of course, would have required him to at least consider cap and trade schemes--something he does not seem prepared to do.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When the US Vice President isn't <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/9722.html">harboring delusions about how swimmingly the occupation of Iraq is going</a>, he apparently spends a considerable amount of time helping campaign contributors get no-bid federal contracts.

No, we're not talking about t<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2007/01/17/bremer-gets-invitation-%e2%80%93-from-waxman/">he travesty of Iraqi "reconstruction."</a>  Rather, <a href="http://hughbartling.blogspot.com/2007/01/how-politics-influenced-big-clean-up.html">as the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday</a>, Cheney has been involved in promoting a scheme concocted by a couple of Southern California entrepreneurs and Republican campaign donors to treat sewage running into the country from the booming northern Mexican metropolis of Tijuana.

The corruption angle in the story is pretty straight-forward: the businessmen meet with Cheney, local Congressman--including 2008 Republican Presidential Candidate <a href="http://www.gohunter08.com/Home.aspx">Duncan Hunter</a>, give them campaign contributions, and soon thereafter the donors are given a no-bid contract for the clean-up.

If the corruption isn't bad enough, the article discusses how the plan itself--which involves diverting run-off that has reached the US back to a treatment facility in Mexico, where it is diverted once again after processing back to California, and then pumped into the ocean-- has been called unworkable by government regulators.

One of the main problems that the scheme can not address is the fact that much of the sewage leeching into the Tijuana River and smaller arroyos leading into the United States comes from dispersed points of origin.  Tijuana's massive population growth as a result of trade liberalization policies initiated in the 1990s has not been accompanied by the requisite development of modern infrastructure.  Slums and squatter communities have emerged in the highlands around the city and the waste produced in these settlements is not captured by any sewer--rather it flows unimpeded into the various valleys around the metropolis.

This is a much larger problem than can be addressed by an ill-conceived treatment scheme and highlights the real lack of leadership in dealing constructively with pressing environmental problems.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rep. Henry Waxman, Chair of the <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/">House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform</a>, is holding a hearings today on whether government employees have been pressured by the Bush Administration to downplay the scientific evidence relating to anthropogenic global warming.

This is especially apposite as there are <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/29/AR2007012901426.html">several bills being considered in the House and Senate</a> dealing with climate change as well as <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/pressreleases?id=0038">Speaker Pelosi's new Select Committee</a>.

Additionally, the political pressure on government scientists appears to be on the increase as the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/washington/30rules.html?ex=1327813200&en=cfa88d4738fced9a&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">New York Times reports today</a> that all executive branch agencies must have their proposals to define regulations vetted by Bush appointees.  This makes it likely that government scientists will continue to be sidelined in favor of the narrow special interests represented by the administration.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Committees from both the US House and Senate yesterday took up the issue of climate change, albeit in a fairly modest fasion.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/29/AR2007012901426.html">Barbara Boxer held an "open mic" session</a> where Senators could expound on their concern for the effects of climate change and express disappointment that nothing has been done about it--conveniently forgetting that they are in a unique position to actually make policy.

The House hearing, chaired by Henry Waxman, had more substance.   His focus was primarily on the ways in which the Bush administration has silenced government scientists and distorted climatological studies.  <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/57ddbaea-b0c4-11db-8a62-0000779e2340.html">The Financial Times has a good run-down of the hearings</a>--particularly the testimony of former senior associate with the Climate Change Science Office, Rick Piltz--who points out that all of his reports had to be vetted by a Philip Cooney--a Bush appointee whose previous job was as a petroleum industry lobbyist.  <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/31/1543215">The radio show, Democracy Now,</a> has some interesting excerpts from the hearing, particularly involving NASA scientist Drew Shindell who explained that political appointees forbade climate scientists from speaking to the press.

Waxman had some strong words for the administration suggesting a conspiracy to supress information.  I have not watched the entire hearing, but it appears that <a href="http://www.c-span.org">C-Span</a> has it available on their website.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Cautionary Tale Regarding Biofuels</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/business/worldbusiness/31biofuel.html?ex=1327899600&en=e654236de67e8749&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">The New York Times has a good piece on the environmental problems associated with palm oil production</a>.  Palm oil can be thought of as the European equivalent of ethanol, to the extent that it is increasingly sought after as a substitute and additive for petrol.  Unlike ethanol--which in the US is primarily produced domestically--Europe requires extensive imports of plam oil, given that it is a tropical crop.

The article points out that Indonesia and Malaysia have been expanding their production of palm oil as the demand for biodiesel increases in Europe.  As a result, more rainforests and peatlands are being transformed into palm plantations, causing significant localized environmental problems, <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/article570195.ece">while the big European importers reap the benefits of a so-called "green fuel."</a>

Given dwindling global fossil fuel supplies and increasing demand for alternatives, it remains unclear what types of policy shifts can take place.  <a href="http://www.allaboutfeed.net/tsal/allaboutfeed.portal/enc/_nfpb/true/_nfpb/true/_pageLabel/ts_page_news/ts_portlet_news_singleeditorschoice_3_actionOverride/___2Fportlets___2Fts___2Fcore___2Fnews_singleeditorschoice___2Fcontent___2FshowDetailsList/_mode/view/ts_portlet_news_singleeditorschoice_3channel/102/ts_portlet_news_singleeditorschoice_3id/6645/_desktopLabel/allaboutfeed/">Large multinational agribusinesses like Cargill are building European refineries</a> to facilitate the processing required to turn the raw oil into biodeisel.  The governments of Malaysia and <a href="http://www.tempointeractive.com/hg/ekbis/2007/01/31/brk,20070131-92307,uk.html">Indonesia show little resolve to adequately regulate</a> the production and other countries, <a href="http://www.btimes.com.my/Current_News/BT/Monday/Column/BT603756.txt/Article/">like Venezuela,</a> are getting into the palm oil game.

As the discussion in the US turns to ethanol as a replacement for petrol, it is important to recognize that there are significant ecological consequences associated with the production of biofuels.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Blair to Devote Post-PM Period to Laying Ground for Kyoto II</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is planning on leaving office sometime this summer, is apparently going to dedicate his post-Ministerial days to building global consensus on climate change.  According to <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/article2268083.ece">The Independent</a> this will involve heavy lobbying of US politicians and engaging India and China to develop a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol.

Whether Blair will be effective is unclear.  His main environment adviser, David Milliband, is taking an interesting approach by engaging with state and local politicians in the US rather than the Bush Administration.  The assumption appears to be that if many of the large states like California adopt CO2 emissions reduction targets, then systems will be in place for Bush's successor to easily establish a federal program.

Climate change policy influence and change is proceeding in an interesting fashion.  It is separate from the traditional singularly elite stage of negotiations between heads of states, on the one hand.  But, on the other hand, it is not clearly a "grass roots" global movement.  Rather, we have high-profile elites engaging sub-nationally to affect policy change.

The situation resembles a loose coalition of like-minded advocates intervening at the most opportune governmental levels and employing a variety of methods.  A good example of this process might be the efforts by California's Attorney General--and former governor--<a href="http://www.montereyherald.com/mld/montereyherald/business/16605372.htm">Jerry Brown who is proceeding with a lawsuit</a> against major automobile manufacturers for repayment of damages caused by greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles.  Even the threat of a lawsuit from the largest state in the US could prompt automobile makers to produce more environmentally-friendly cars nationally.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/article/182024">Yesterday in the Canadian House of Commons</a>, opposition parties passed <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/legisinfo/index.asp?Language=E&Chamber=N&StartList=A&EndList=Z&Session=14&Type=0&Scope=I&query=4741&List=toc-1">Bill C-288</a> which instructs the minority government led by Conservative Prime Minister to develop a climate change plan in the next 60 days that will meet the country's obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.   Under the bill, if the government fails to do this any Canadian citizen or pressure group can take the government to court.
This is a unique occurrence in Canada's parliamentary system, since it generally difficult for opposition parties to pass legislation.  The bill still has to pass the Senate, but there is a clear Liberal majority in there which will likely approve the measure.

This comes at a time when <a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/article/182027">Harper's government has been gutting</a> the government's Clean Development Mechanism office which coordinates Canadian funding of offset programs in the developing world as part of the Kyoto agreement.

It will be interesting to see if this is the beginning of the end for Harper's government and if the Liberals will use climate change as the vehicle for taking back control.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[New York Times economics columnist David Leonhardt <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/business/21leonhardt.html?ex=1329714000&en=846690277bf060af&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">has an interesting report</a> from last week's debate at Yale University between Sir Nicolas Stern--author of <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm">last year's high-profile analysis</a> of the costs of inaction on climate change--and a variety of more skeptical economists, including noted environmental economist <a href="http://nordhaus.econ.yale.edu/">William Nordhaus</a>.

The debate seems to boil down to the perennial question facing practitioners of environmental policy: namely, how to deal with risk.  Nordhaus faults Stern for making unreasonable assumptions about intergenerational equity.  Stern's basic argument is that we must make costly changes to human behavior now in order to avert economic catastrophe far into the future.   Nordhaus is uncomfortable with this claim primarily due to the fact that there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding technical changes and economic growth.  Nordhaus argues that future generations will likely be richer than our own and, hence, more able to respond to challenges posed by climate change.

Obviously both Stern and Nordhaus need to make certain assumptions about the future when developing models relating to the effects of particular policy interventions.  Stern is much more precautionary--an approach that seems to have much more currency in Europe than in US policymaking circles.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/ec641f20-c045-11db-995a-000b5df10621.html">Financial Times reported</a> on an effort spearheaded by German chancellor Angela Merkel to engage the Bush administration in talks about creating a "transatlantic trading zone" between the US and the European Union.  The report quoted the US ambassador to the EU, Boyden Gray, as saying that the administration is willing to engage in talks later this year with their EU counterparts.

Obviously, at this early stage, it is unclear what a "trading zone" would look like--particularly given the traditional unilateral streak in American politics.  According to the article, the effort for coordination is being introduced by members of the <a href="http://www.tpnonline.org/index.html">Transatlantic Policy Network</a>--an organization consisting of EU parliamentary members and members of Congress.

Tomorrow, US Senator Robert Bennett is meeting with the EU President Jose Manuel Barosso to discuss a timetable for negotiations that deal with key sectors.

It is clear that emissions policy will be a potential sticking point of the discussions.  This comes on the heels of <a href="http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0220/carbon.html">yesterday's decision by EU environment ministers</a> to unilaterally cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20% of 1990 levels by the year 2020.  They agreed to push that percentage up to 30% if the US joined the agreement.]]></content:encoded>

A <a href="http://toronto.craigslist.org/search/tix?query=gore">quick search of Craigslist</a> reveals people <a href="http://toronto.craigslist.org/tix/282166598.html">willing to pay $500</a> (Cdn) for a last minute ticket!  I'm wondering if the lucky sellers of the $20 tickets are going to donate their profit to a <a href="http://www.offsetters.ca/">carbon offset scheme</a>?  For those Torontans unable to attend, <a href="http://www.greenpeacevolunteers.ca/node/276">Greenpeace is hosting a "candelight vigil"</a> at Convocation Hall on the University of Toronto campus prior to Gore's speech.

If any Canadian readers happen to attend Gore's talk, please offer your impressions in the comments.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the most interesting policy initiatives to quell suburban sprawl in North America has been underway in Ontario over the past two years.  The Provincial government of Premier Dalton McGuinty developed two legislative actions in 2005.  One--the <a href="http://www.mah.gov.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_22185_1.html">Greenbelt Plan</a>--designated a wide, outer-ring of land on the exurban fringe of the Hamilton to Toronto "Golden Horseshoe" to be protected from urban development.  The legislation included a map of protected land and offered significant Provinical control over local land use decisions.  The second piece of legislation--<a href="http://www.pir.gov.on.ca/english/growth/index.html">The Places to Grow Act</a>--designates urban growth centers throughout the province that emphasize mixed-use, high-density, and multiple forms of mobility.

The idea of looking at growth policy in this two-pronged way is something that planners and policy analysts have been advocating for years, but the political obstacles tend to overshadow the efficacy of the plans.

Marking the two year anniversary of the Greenbelt Plan, the Ontario Greenbelt Alliance--a coalition of civic advocacy groups in the province--issued a <a href="http://www.greenbelt.ca/reports/secondreportcard.htm">"report card"</a> assessing the plan.

In an improvement over <a href="http://www.greenbelt.ca/reports/reportcard.htm">last year's report card</a>, the province was given a B+. Among the accomplishments was an expansion of the Rouge Park metropolitan wilderness area and instances of the Provincial government defending the integrity of lands designated for protection by resisting local efforts at exemption.

There have also been numerous problems--particularly with regard to exemptions for quarries to be developed in protected lands as well as the inevitible "leapfrogging" of development whereby areas past the outer boundaries of the Greenbelt are now experiencing increased development pressures.

The Greenbelt Alliance argues that the protected area should be expanded over the next year.

For more coverage of the report card, see the <a href="http://www.thestar.com/article/186452">Toronto Star</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Canadian Feds Pump Money To Expand Toronto&#039;s Subway</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.thestar.com/article/187860">Toronto Star is reporting</a> that Conservative PM Stephen Harper and Liberal Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty are going to announce a commitment from the federal government of $670 million [Cdn] to help <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/spadina_extension/general.htm">finance the expansion</a> of Toronto's Spadina Subway line 8.6 kilometers to York University and North to the York Region community of Vaughn.

Once completed, this will represent the first really major rapid transit link in the Greater Toronto Region and an essential element in Ontario's urban centre growth strategy--which I mentioned in a post yesterday.  The federal commitment will mark a third of the funds needed to complete the project.

The article speculates that both McGuinty and Harper may gain politically from the announcement given speculation that federal elections may be forced this spring and provincial elections will take place within the next few months.  The suburban residents of the GTA who will benefit from the project are key swing voters.

An interesting aspect of the Spadina extension from the perspective of US observers is the cost of the project.  The total cost for the subway will be around $1.7 billion US dollars.  Compare that to <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/news/whatsnew2.wu?action=displaynewspostingdetail&articleid=117176">the proposed Circle Line</a> being contemplated by the Chicago Transit Authority.  The Circle Line would be a little longer [10km] but would likely be elevated--rather than subterranean, like Toronto's--and would come in at <a href="http://chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=23556&rel=1">$3 billion</a>.

Subways are generally more expensive to construct than elevated lines, so why is going to cost so much more to construct the Circle Line?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bush&#039;s Illogical Energy &#034;Plan&#034; on Display in Brazil</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[US President George W. Bush is in the midst of a high-profile trip to Latin America.  The first stop on the trip was to Brazil where he met today with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/09/AR2007030900767.html">The two toured an biodiesel production facility</a> and declared the two countries' commitment to promting ethanol consumption in the region.
Bush, of course, has been trumpeting ethanol as a substitution for imported petroleum for the United States in spite of the fact that production of corn-based varieties of the fuel in the US are highly dependent on federal subsidies and require significant inputs of energy for production.  An <a href="http://www.freenewmexican.com/news/58262.html">AP article today asserts</a> that there is a 51 cent subsidy for each gallon of ethanol.  In Brazil ethanol is produced using sugar--not corn.  Though <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/environment/climate_change/article2328821.ece">there are environmental problems associated with
ethanol production in Brazil</a>, it is still able to produce it more efficiently than the US.  Yet, the US maintains a 54 cent tariff on Brazilian imports.

At today's news conference Bush said he is unwilling to consider removing the tariff, which raises questions about his entire energy policy.  Rather than being concerned with looking at alternatives to fossil fuels, his major interest seems to be supporting corporate agribusinesses <a href="http://hughbartling.blogspot.com/2007/03/ethanol-tariff-loophole-sparks-boom-in.html">who control both domestic production and are increasingly asserting their presence in the developing world, as well</a>.]]></content:encoded>

While Google's main interest for providing the service is undoubtedly to attract the best talent in a competitive environment for skilled workers, the fact that a private company is setting up its own transit system is more of a commentary on the result of decades of poor regional planning in the Bay Area.

Workers are spread throughout the region in search of housing and subject to land use regulation that has been established without regard to regional employment patterns.  Large and profitable companies like Google can afford to offer the service as a benefit, but in the absence of public networks of transit, higher density, and mixed-use development issues of mobility in the region will continue to persist.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ontario&#039;s Greenbelt Experiencing &#034;Leap Frog&#034; Development</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the past couple of weeks I have posted a couple times on the rather innovative Greenbelt and "Places to Grow" legislation passed a couple of years ago in Ontario to control the Greater Toronto Area's growth by both protecting un-urbanized land and encouraging development in provincially-defined urban centres.

<a href="http://www.thestar.com/article/190337">Today, the Toronto Star has an interesting article</a> on the ways in which sprawling development is "leapfrogging" past the greenbelt to northern communities in Simcoe County.  This process of pushing sprawl outwards is one of the problems with establishing protected greenbelts.  In the recent Report Card evaluation published by the Greenbelt Alliance, one of their main recommendations to the province was to expand the greenbelt.

Interestingly, Municipal Affairs Minister John Gerretson is quoted in the article as saying he supports an expansion.  This issue will undoubtedly feature prominently in provincial elections likely to take place in the next few months as citizens are often skeptical of more growth while municipalities are critical of having the province subvert their autonomy.]]></content:encoded>

Post</a>, <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0403/p01s01-usju.html?page=1">CSMonitor</a>, <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2414728.ece">Independent</a>) are reporting on the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=05-1120">Supreme Court's decision</a> in the case of Massachusetts vs. EPA.  It is an important decision for a number of reasons:

1) It requires the EPA to consider greenhouse gases "pollutants" that merit regulation under the Clean Air Act.   For students who may be reading this from my Implementation class, the issue at hand is an interesting case of an implementation agency (the EPA) using their latitude of interpretation in such a way as to depart from the objectives of a statute.

At issue was the EPA's unwillingness to declare greenhouse gases as falling under its regulatory purview.  The Clean Air Act gives the EPA Administrator some "judgment" in forming regulations to protect "public health and welfare" from air pollution.  Massachusetts and other co-petitioners thought that the EPA needed to regulate motor vehicle emissions on the basis that these emissions contributed to changes in climate that would have negative affects on their localities.

With the court siding with Massachusetts they are essentially requiring the EPA to develop a regulatory strategy to meet the demands of the legislation.

2) The decision provides further evidence of the development of a political consensus around the idea that anthropogenic climate change is a public policy issue.  By no means is there a consensus around how to deal with greenhouse gas emissions, but given the recent reluctance of the Bush Administration and some members of Congress to question the extent to which climate change is even a problem, this ruling is significant.  Although it was a split decision, with the most conservative members of the court (Roberts, Alito, Thomas, and Scalia) dissenting, it still suggests that the issue is continuing to attain relevance.

3) Finally, the dissent centered around the argument that Massachusetts, et al. did not have standing to file suit against the EPA.  This has been a consistent obstacle in environmental policy cases.  The fact that the majority rejected this claim suggests that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/03/us/03impact.html">other suits will not be thrown out for lack of standing</a>.

The next step will be to see <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-me-greencalif3apr03,0,6472343.story?track=mostviewed-homepage">how the EPA reacts to the court's judgement</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The UN-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM6avr07.pdf">latest summary report [.pdf]</a> for policymakers last night.  For the past several days the final draft has been the subject of intense negotiation and re-wording. According to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/06/AR2007040600291.html?hpid=topnews">Washington Post</a>, governmental delegats from the US, China,and Saudi Arabia objected to strongly worded pronouncements about the dire affects of anthropogenic climate change.

Nevertheless, the report is still pretty devastating. It highlights the extreme vulnerability of the globe's poorest regions to climate change and highlights the issue of equity.  It is anticipated that the findings from the report will be invoked during June's G-8 summit as European leaders seek the US to engage in talks on a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol that will entail mandatory caps on greenhouse gases.

In a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/04/20070406.html">press conference by the White House's two point people on the issue</a>--Sharon Hays of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and Jim Connaughton, Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality--the administration spokespeople seemed to play down the main findings of the report.  Hays claimed that "not all projected impacts are negative" and that countries "are able to lessen the impacts of climate change through adaptation."  The report acknowledges adaptation, however, it asserts that "adaptation alone is not expected to cope with all the projected effects of climate change, and especially not over the long run as most impacts increase in magnitude" <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM6avr07.pdf">[p. 18]</a>.
When pressed on the Administration's position to a Kyoto-style mandatory limitation on greenhouse gas emissions, Connaugton strangely started talking about building codes and appliance efficiency standards clearly avoiding the question.

He did express some candor at the end of the press conference when he said that the report "reinforces" the Administration's position.  This is likely to mean that Bush won't budge when Blair and Merkel force the issue in June.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Canada&#039;s Tories Release Emissions Plan</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The minority government of Tory PM Stephen Harper announced their plan for reducing carbon emissions yesterday.  Ever since Harper took over last year and indicated that he had no intention of meeting Kyoto-mandated reduction targets, he has been subject to intense criticism from various opposition parties.

Yesterday's announcement did little to assuage opposition concern.  <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070427.RCLIMATE27/TPStory/National">The plan gives significant concessions to industry</a> by not requiring new plants to abide by the emissions targets for three years after their construction.  This provision was designed specifically to make sure that the expansion of mining efforts in Alberta's oil sands continues.

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/27/AR2007042701754.html">Oil and gas company stocks surged yesterday</a> on Toronto's stock exchange while prominent environmentalists such as David Suzuki and <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070428.wgoreemissions0428/BNStory/National">Al Gore</a> lambasted the plan.

Last year there was speculation that the Tory's abandonment of Kyoto targets could bring down the government and force new elections.  However, this doesn't appear likely at this point.  Yesterday, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070428.wxclimate28/BNStory/National">NDP leader Jack Layton sent a letter to the leaders of the Liberal Party and the Bloc Québécois</a> to request that the opposition emissions plan be subjected to a full vote in the House of Commons.]]></content:encoded>

Daley.  The two men (pictured here flanking US EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson) have a relatively close relationship forged through their <a href="http://www.nemw.org/glci/index.html">active roles in Great Lakes issues</a>.  While many environmentalists in both Chicago and Toronto might be less inclined to accept uncritically assertions that the two mayors are inherently "green," they both have at least put envrionmental issues on the urban policy agenda in their respective cities.

The Star article is particularly useful in its measured tone and its willingness to offer critique of Chicago's record in some areas of environmental justice.  Peter Gorrie, The Star's environment writer, <a href="http://www.thestar.com/Article/208355">also has a side piece</a> on the perennial problem of sulphur dioxide emissions from the Crawford electricity generation station in the Little Village neighborhood on the city's southwest side.  Gorrie's article discusses the hands-off approach taken by the Mayor with regard to this issue.

In this regard it is important to recognize the distinctions between "beautifying" the city and tackling serious public health hazards when assessing Chicago's "green" reputation.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Climate Change on Back Burner at US-EU Summit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[German Chancellor Angela Merkel and chief European Union executive Jose Barroso will be in Washington on Monday to meet with US President George Bush on EU-US relations.  After the latest UN report on climate change was released earlier this month, it has been speculated that Merkel and the EU would use it as evidence to push Bush into action on reducing US greenhouse gas emissions.

While the key meeting of the G-8 in June is supposed to have climate change high on the agenda for G-8 leaders, this April summit was likely to have been a first step in developing some sort of agreement with the US.  That is why it is disconcerting to see <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSL258968720070425?pageNumber=1">Barroso say earlier this week that climate change is unlikely to figure prominently in Monday's discussions</a>.

It is unclear whether this is a deliberate EU strategy or whether Merkel and Barroso are waiting until the more high-profile June meeting to push the issue.  The latter may indeed be the path they are seeking to take.  Yesterday Barroso met with new UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon who surprised Bush earlier this year with his pledge to put climate change at the top of the UN agenda during his tenure.

After the meeting with Barroso, <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/27/news/UN-GEN-UN-Climate-Change.php">Ban reiterated his plan to profile climate change at the June G-8 meeting</a> and expressed support for Al Gore's work on the issue.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[During <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rm/84003.htm">yesterday's press conference</a> with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and EU President Jose Manuel Barosso, US President George W. Bush reported:
<blockquote><font size="2" face="Arial">We also talked about climate, and here we share a common interest: One, we recognize that we have a problem with greenhouse gases; two, we recognize we have a problem with a dependence on oil; three, we recognize that we can use technologies to help solve this problem; and, four, we recognize we have an obligation to work together to promote the technologies necessary to solve the problem, and encourage the developing world to use those technologies.</font></blockquote>
This is a long-winded way of saying that the US is not budging on its opposition to a comprehensive cap and trade system for regulating emissions such as the one adopted by the EU to meet its Kyoto Protocol committments.

Bush tried to justify his questionable ethanol program as an example of the US getting serious about climate change.  However, what went unmentioned was the high subsidies that go into ethanol production and the fact that <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0323/p01s01-sten.html">ethanol refineries are often powered by carbon-emitting coal</a>.

The issue of agricultural subsidies was also discussed yesterday with reference to the stalemated Doha Round of trade talks.  The main sticking point on the Doha round is Western agricultural subsidies on the one hand, and developing countries' protected markets, on the other.  <a href="http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=264262">Bush indicated that he would be willing to press for reduction in agricultural subsidies</a> if other countries went along and if global markets were opened.  It is unclear how this would mesh with an expansion of ethanol since <a href="http://www.ewg.org/farm/progdetail.php?fips=00000&progcode=corn">corn production has received $51 billion in subsidies</a> over the past ten years.

<a href="http://www.farmpolicy.com/?p=266">Keith Good at FarmPolicy.com has a good breakdown</a> of the complexities of the Doha Round and its impacts on US agriculture.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://hughbartling.blogspot.com/2007/05/as-its-population-declines-youngstown.html">Wall Street Journal has an interesting report today </a>on urban redevelopment efforts in Youngstown, Ohio.  Like many smaller industrial cities in the Midwest US, Youngstown's economy and employment base evaporated during the 1970s and 1980s as manufacturing sectors moved offshore.

For the city, this has meant a severe decline in population and all of the associated problems associated with economic decline: crime, forclosures, depleted infrastructure.  The approach that the city is taking to redevelopment is rather unique.

Seeing abandoned lots as a possible opportunity, the city is encouraging owners--who may be delinquent on their taxes--to relinquish their properties.  The city would then link vacated lots and unneeded streets through demolishing and building green space and park land.  Thus, the Rust Belt city would be enhanced with a new, green infrastructure.

The article isn't clear on the costs involved in such a scheme.  But the general plan is similar to the <a href="http://www.urbanlab.com/h2o/">one developed for Chicago by the local firm UrbanLab</a>--<a href="http://arcchicago.blogspot.com/2007/02/urbanlab-wins-city-of-future.html">which recently won</a> the History Channel's City of the Future Competition.  Yesterday, students and I attended the <a href="http://www.uic.edu/orgs/daleyforum/index.html">Richard J. Daley Urban Forum</a> at UIC where UrbanLab's Sarah Dunn gave a presentation on the Chicago scheme.  She essentially advocates the same approach that is being taken in Youngstown: link neighborhoods with substantial concentrations of vacant lots as the first component of a network of eco-boulevards.

Dunn's goal is a bit more radical.  Her eco-boulevards would act as natural systems of bioremediation for wastewater treatment.  Essentially the street would be repaced by passive wetlands.  It wasn't clear what would happen to the cars!

The same idea animates both Dunn's plan and the project in Youngstown: re-think an urban liability in such a way as to make it a positive element for enhancing quality of life.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UN Climate Change Panel Releases Third Report</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The United Nations-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its third report of the year yesterday.  The latest installment focused on the economic aspects associated with minimizing greenhouse gases. Among the findings in the report is an estimation that establishing policies that would minimize the most negative affects of global warming would reduce the output of the world's economy by 3% in 2030. The cost for minimizing carbon dioxide--the main greenhouse gas-- emissions is estimated in the report to be between $20 and $100 per ton.

<a href="http://hughbartling.blogspot.com/2007/05/climate-economics.html">The Wall Street Journal gives a good run-down</a> of the reactions to the report. Most envrionmentalists and businesses agreed with report's estimates and acknowledged that mitigation and adaptation could be accomplished without significant macroeconomic affects.  The Bush Administration, on the other hand, predicts economic catastrophe if current behaviors are modified.

One of the interesting aspects of the report was that the cost estimates were based on the assumption that emissions reduction will be tackled worldwide in the most economically efficient manner.  Given the fact that the United States, China, and India are not taking significant steps to reduce emissions at this juncture, the costs in the long run will likely be higher.

Here is a run down of global reaction to the IPCC report:

<a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2473835,00.html">EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas </a>uses the occasion to call for urgent negotiations on a post-Kyoto regime of emissions reduction targets.

<a href="http://winnipegsun.com/News/Canada/2007/05/05/4155506-sun.html">Canadian opposition parties are using the report to criticize</a> PM Stephen Harper's recent decision to forego Kyoto.

<a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=31&art_id=vn20070505095506844C159190">The Star (Pretoria, South Africa) highlights the changes in individual behavior </a>discussed in the report.

<a href="http://www.france24.com/france24Public/en/administration/afp-news.html?id=070505033033.2rx49uqv&cat=null">AFP is reporting that the Chinese media largely ignored the report.</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Energy Bill May Phase Out Incandescent Light Bulbs</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=101</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://hughbartling.blogspot.com/2007/05/households-would-need-new-bulbs.html">The Wall Street Journal reports on negotiations</a> in the US Congress on establishing new standards on lighting as a way of increasing energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions.  At issue is an interesting dialogue consisting of manufacturers, consumer groups, and environmentalists to gradually phase out incandecent light bulbs in favor of compact fluroescent light bulbs.

If the old filament bulbs are phased out, the Journal reports that the US would need 23 fewer power plants, 115 tons of CO2 would be eliminated and consumers would save $13 billion dollars on their energy bills.

One of the interesting aspects animating this issue is the fact that many <a href="http://www.napavalleyregister.com/articles/2007/04/23/news/other/iq_3921500.txt">state legislatures</a> and <a href="http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070429/NEWS/704290353">governors</a> are further along than the federal government in looking at the shift to more energy-efficient bulbs.  This is primarily due to the fact that there has been a lack of leadership at the federal level on climate change and many states are seeing that they need to fill in the gap.

Here in Illiniois, Governor Blagojevich's  <a href="http://www.epa.state.il.us/air/climatechange/index.html">Climate Change Advisory Group</a> has been  dealing with the issue of enhancing consumer electricity efficiency.  Yesterday, the  Power and Energy Sub-Group considered a <a href="http://www.epa.state.il.us/air/climatechange/documents/subgroups/power-energy/incandescent-phaseout.pdf">proposal [.pdf]</a> to phase out incandescent bulbs as part of its eventual report to the governor.

Light bulb manufacturers see value in establishing a federal standard given the potential difficulty in coordinating production for many different requirements set by each state.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Courtesy of the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0705090110may09,1,6246343.story?page=1&coll=chi-news-hed">Chicago Tribune</a>, we learn that residents in the suburban community of Northbrook are critical of the village's plan to put sidewalks in certain residential neighborhoods.  Northbrook is one of your typical post-War suburbs that was designed primarily for automobiles.  In the rush to develop at the least cost, such frivolities as places for pedestrians were discarded.

Seeing the shortcomings of such development, many suburbs are trying to remedy the anachronistic elements of their built form by retrofitting them with sidewalks.  Interestingly, the source of discontent from residents is less due to the cost associated with the post-hoc installation of sidewalks, and more due to a general paranoia.

One person interviewed in the article rejects sidewalks because of the unsavory element that it might attract!  Perhaps a better reason is the fact that there is nowhere to walk!

<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/219/491621468_c58848245a.jpg?v=0" />
Above is an areal picture of a typical Northbrook neighborhood with its cul-de-sacs and poorly-linked streets.  While this neighborhood appears to have sidewalks, I am not sure where you would go.  Restricted zoning has separated residential areas from workplaces and shopping and the area is not served by mass transit.  Perhaps these sidewalk naysayers have a point!]]></content:encoded>

Sponsored by the <a href="http://www.clintonfoundation.org/cf-pgm-cci-home.htm">Clinton Climate Initiative</a> and the <a href="http://www.c40cities.org/">C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group</a>, the summit will bring together mayors for three days of chat about climate change and what cities can do to address the issue.  The summit's website is a little short on details of the program, so we may expect nothing more than typical political posturing.
Mayor David Miller, of Toronto, however is <a href="http://www.thestar.com/article/213194">apparently going to suggest the idea of a "green Facebook"</a> so people can harness social networking tools to battle climate change.  If this is, indeed, the type of stuff they are going to talk about, the meeting's superficiality is assured.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As people here in <a href="http://www.chicago2016.org/">Chicago wait</a> for the International Olympic Committee to announce the host city for the 2016 games, it might be useful to keep a close eye on how another North American city is preparing for its own Olympics.

Vancouver, BC is hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics and is in the midst of completing the infrastructure projects needed to accomodate the thousands of anticipated visitors.  One of the main challenges facing Vancouver is a modest mass transit system.  As part of the effort to improve the SkyTrain, they committed to <a href="http://www.canadaline.ca/">building a subway</a> connecting the airport (south of the city) to the city centre and Burrard Inlet.

<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070512.wbcolymp0522/BNStory/National/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20070512.wbcolymp0522">The Globe and Mail today reports</a> that the transit authority has reneged on its promise to bore the tunnel underground in favor of a cheaper--but more disruptive--approach: digging up the streets.

Currently the trendy Cambie Street is apparently completely torn up making it difficult for the small businesses to attract customers.  While the Olympics will undoubtedly bring tourists with money to spend to the city, the small businesses profiled in the article are not sure if they will be able to stay in business long enough to reap the benefits of the games.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On the heels of Tony Blair's announcement that he will step down as head of the Labour Party next month, his likely successor, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, <a href="http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/sunday/tm_headline=exclusive--brown-s-eco-town-plan&method=full&objectid=19095410&siteid=98487-name_page.html">proposed that new "eco-towns" of approximately 20,000 inhabitants be constructed </a>throughout the country.

The towns would be constructed by private developers on government-controlled land, the first one being located in Cambridgeshire on a decommissioned air base.  The aim would be to insure affordability while maintaining zero-carbon output by employing green design features.

This is Brown's first concrete policy proposal in his bid for leadership of Labour and, <a href="http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=739892007">as the Scotsman reports</a>, likely aimed at placating leftists in the party who may support more radical candidates.

Brown, of course, has been building up his green credentials for quite a while.  The culmination of these efforts was his solicitation of Sir Nicholas Stern last year to develop a report on the economic implications of climate change.  He also recently won the support of Blair's popular Environment Minister, David Miliband, who many Blairites wanted to challenge Brown for party leadership.

It will be interesting to see what happens to Miliband.  Some are arguing that he should be appointed <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/focus/story/0,,2078585,00.html">Chancellor</a> while others think he may be tapped for <a href="http://www.yorkshiretoday.co.uk/news?articleid=2871242">Home Secretary</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,21771324-5003680,00.html">The Advertiser from Adelaide</a>--Australia's fifth largest city--reports on an innovative urban water conservation strategy being employed in the city's suburbs.

Many homes in the region already have tank systems that collect rain water for reuse in the form of drinking water and irrigation.  The details are sketchy, but the article suggests that a new program is being developed to recharge groundwater acquifers with the collected rain water.  In much the same fashion as <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/jul2006/sb20060706_167332.htm?campaign_id=search">many users of solar power sell their excess energy back to electric companies</a>, the scheme in Adelaide will give consumers credit when excess water from their storage tanks is diverted back to recharge the groundwater.

This seems to fit in with the state of <a href="http://www.waterproofingadelaide.sa.gov.au/main/">South Australia's larger goal for sustainable water use</a> and seems to be an innovative policy for encouraging conservation.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Local Food Systems in British Columbia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Advocates for localized food production in the suburbs of Vancouver, BC <a href="http://www.richmondreview.com/portals-code/list.cgi?paper=45&cat=23&id=987804&more=">are pushing for a decomissioned Canadian Coast Guard site to be transformed</a> into a showpiece for local agriculture within a suburbanized setting.

The proposal includes garden plots, an orchard, gardening educational opportunities, and a food bank for low income citizens.

This proposal represents a growing trend in North America to address the potential problems with a food system that is increasingly globalized.  With rising transportation costs, consumer skepticism about food safety, and increasing interest in diversifying regional economies, efforts to localize food sources will likely continue to grow.

Apparently the Richmond, BC effort involves Alisa Smith and James MacKinnon whose new book--<a href="http://100milediet.org/home/">The 100 Mile Diet</a>--documents their attempt to only consume food that originates within 100 miles of Vancouver.  I have not yet read the book, but hope to put it on my summer reading list.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Suburban Farming US-Style</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In keeping with the previous post on the effort to enhance local food systems in suburban Vancouver, <a href="http://realestate.yahoo.com/Real_estate_news/story?s=rej/item-59bca77002cf85c445ae05f8dff2f461.html">the Wall Street Journal recently published</a> an interesting article on the small, but growing, trend of US suburban developments with working agriculture themes.

These developments tend to be a modification of the New Urbanist paradigm that incorporate residental and commercial properties with some type of sustainability or small-scale agriculture component.  The most prominent in the Chicago region is Prairie Crossing in Lake County that has its own working farm.

On the one hand, these developments seem like a novel way of minimizing sprawl by preserving productive green space.  On the other hand, they could easily go the way of many New Urbanism developments and serve to justify sprawling development and the lack of regional integration under the cover of sustainability.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US Rejects Preliminary G-8 Agreement on Climate Change</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In anticipation for next month's G-8 summit to be held in Germany, the various G-8 countries have been negotiating an agreement on climate change that will set the stage for talks regarding a successor to the Kyoto Protocol which ends in 2012.

Yesterday, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/25/AR2007052501952.html?hpid%3Dtopnews&sub=AR">it became clear that US intransigence on the issue is unlikely to wane.</a>  The EU members, led by German Chancellor Anglea Merkel, are unified in their interest in pushing the US to seriously negotiate.

The US, however, is opposing key components of the agreement:

1) They are rejecting that the United Nations be the forum for negotiating climate change.

2) They are against establishing benchmarks for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation

3) They are rejecting a commitment to increasing energy efficiency by 30% by 2030

4) They are rejecting a recognition that the G-8 should limit global temperature increase to 2 degrees centigrade.

5) They are against increasing the percentage of renewable fuels to 15% of total consumption by  2020

6) They want to insert language supporting the expansion of nuclear energy.

7) They want to reject the "call upon all parties to strengthen the global system for effective protection of men, environment, and facilities against nuclear hazards."

8) They want to add language encouraging the expansion of government-held strategic oil reserves.

These are pretty radical positions and it will be unlikely that any significant bridging of gaps can take place before the June 6 meeting.

The environmental group, <a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/archives/2007/05/us_harpoons_g8_climate_languag.html">Greenpeace</a>, was leaked the <a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/makingwaves/G8%20Summit%20Declaration%20-%20US%20comments%20May%2014-1.pdf">draft document [.pdf]</a> complete with US strike-throughs and additions.  The document is a remarkable read and one that does not inspire much confidence in anything substantial happening from the US side on climate change in the near future.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week's strike by maintenance workers and mechanics employed by Montreal's public transit agency exposed the vulnerability surrounding the mobility of lower-wage immigrant populations in the city.

The <a href="http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=8aa8cd4b-0d68-475c-bcb0-470f5e37dba1">Montreal Gazette reports</a> that non-immigrant populations were much more likely to have access to automobiles or other transportation options than the city's immigrants.  The article cites a StatsCan report that found 60% of Caribbean immigrants, 58% African immigrants, and 54% of Latin American immigrants rely on Montreal's Metro system.  For native-born Canadians, the figure is 21%.

<a href="http://www.ejrc.cau.edu/transequnews.htm">Robert Bullard has discussed disparities in access to mobility options in the US</a>.  It is interesting to note that this is likely to be an issue in metropolitan areas throughout the world.ff]]></content:encoded>

The problems with coal-based liquid fuel are immense: the costs are astronomical, the greenhouse gas emissions are substantially higher than oil, and the technologies for efficient refinement are unproven.

Nevertheless, there is broad bipartisan support--particularly from Congressional representatives from coal producing states like Barack Obama--and many politicians are referring to coal liquidification when they speak of "alternative" fuels.  Liquified coal may be an "alternative" but it certainly is not renewable and its environmental affects are likely problematic.   This is especially troublesome as l<a href="http://cbs2chicago.com/medillnewsservice/local_story_143210425.html">egislation winds its way through Congress which will give immense governmental subsidies to the coal industry.</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bush Proposes to Hijack and Nullify Climate Talks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The signs have been clear for the past couple of months that US president George Bush was not going to respond favorably to prodding by Tony Blair and Angela Merkel in their effort to engage the US in international talks on climate change set to begin later this year.  Merkel, as host of next week's G-8 summit and current president of the European Union, was particularly interested in seeing Europe and the US agree to a framework of capping emissions and reducing the increase in global temperatures.

In a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/31/AR2007053101071.html">speech</a> stunning in its audacity, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/31/AR2007053100934.html">Bush not only rejected mandatory greenhouse gas emission limits, but also proposed that the US actually take charge of climate talks,</a> ignoring the ongoing discussions under the auspices of the United Nations.  Bush's top climate advisor, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/05/20070531-17.html">James Connaughton, indicated</a> that emissions goals will be "aspirational."

This, of course, runs counter to the framework of Kyoto and the desire to actually strengthen mandatory emissions--rather than Bush's inclination to do away with them.

<a href="http://www.independent.ie/world-news/north-america/bush-climate-plan-branded-a-trojan-horse-690451.html">Reaction in Europe has been muted,</a> at best, with Merkel contending that the UN remains the best forum for continuing talks.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/01/AR2007060102303.html?tid%3Dinformbox&sub=AR">US papers, on the other hand, have been more charitable</a>. Opposition <a href="http://public.cq.com/docs/cqm/cqmidday110-000002523427.html">Democrats have ridiculed the plan</a>.  Regardless, Bush's gambit will undoubtedly make the meetings this week in Hamburg quite tense.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.thestar.com/article/238555">Toronto Star has an interesting article</a> linking climate change and the future of some Great Lakes cities.  Population migration trends in the United States over the past 30 years are well known: de-industrialization in the Northeast and Midwest contributed to the depopulation of many cities while Sunbelt regions in the Southwest and Southeast gained population through expansion of service-sector economic opportunities and relatively low-costs of housing.  For cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Erie, Buffalo and Rochester the results have been devastating while cities like Las Vegas and Phoenix have been thriving.

The reality of climate change, however, is causing many to question the wisdom of increased growth in Sunbelt regions.  The Toronto Star focuses on the specific issue of water.  Marc Reisner's excellent book <a href="http://www.alibris.com/search/books/qwork/879516/used/Cadillac%20Desert:%20The%20American%20West%20and%20Its%20Disappearing%20Water"><em>Cadillac Desert</em></a> chronicled the problems with water acquisition to fuel growth in the arid West.  Climate change threatens to exacerbate many of the water challenges in Western states.  Increasing droughts will be inadequate to recharge groundwater aquifers while the rivers that supply Nevada, California, New Mexico, and Arizona are threatened by decreased snowfall.

The Rustbelt cities, however, have a significant surplus of water.  According to the article, the Great Lakes basin has about a quarter of the world's freshwater supply.  This advantage should place these metropolitan regions at a distinct advantage for future growth.  Of course, the regime of federal governmental policies in the US fails to take into account issues of water scarcity and regional impacts of growth.  In the absence of a change in federal policy, it will be interesting to see if these cities can leverage their ecological advantages to reconfigure their failing economies.]]></content:encoded>

While the state EPAs of both Indiana and Illinois have significant authority to restrict and monitor these pollutants, the fact that the federal <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=3416083">EPA has become more permissive over the past 6 years</a> when it comes to enforcing federal law is also a serious issue.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the past several months I have been following the development of the <a href="http://www.new-songdocity.co.kr/">New Songdo</a> development currently under construction approximately 65 kilometers south of Seoul.  New Songdo is an entirely new city being constructed by the US real estate developer, the Gale Company.

The town is  interesting on multiple levels.  It has been designated by the South Korean government as an economic free trade area with a decidedly globalized orientation.  The town's primary language will be English and it apparently is envisioned as a laboratory for technological and ecological innovation.

It, essentially, is a new utopia for a post-carbon informational age!

Given this hype, its prospects are dim.  <a href="http://www.antara.co.id/en/arc/2007/7/31/new-songdo-in-korea-named-as-green-urbanism-pilot-project/">However, it is notable that the entire town has been labeled as a "Green Urbanism Pilot Project"</a> by the US Green Building Council which is granting the town a LEED-ND designation.  The LEED-ND is a recent designation that rates the town plan on a variety of environmental performance measures al contributing to long-term sustainability.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Minnesota Bridge Collapse and US Infrastructure</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=116</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The tragedy of Minnesota's most-travelled bridge, resulting in the death of at least five people, has put much-needed scruitny on the state of the country's highway system. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/03/AR2007080300722.html?hpid=topnews"> Various media outlets have reported</a> that the specific bridge was rated "structurally deficient" [along with about 70,000 other bridges in the country] by the US Department of Transportation and that there have been concerns about its safety for at least 17 years.

This is not surprising, given the fact that a) highways are extremely expensive to maintain and b) federal and state funding over the past three decades has not even come close to being sufficient enough to meet important levels of  maintenance.

What is more troubling is the fact that the primary mechanism for funding federal highways--the Highway Trust Fund--is projected to continue its downward trend in receipts, while higher disbursements are forecast for the next four years. [<a href="http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-06-572T">See this .pdf</a> from the General Accounting Office for a good background on the HTF].

This impending crisis has been well-known.  In spite of this, there has been little concern at the federal level.  During the prolonged effort to reauthorize the major transportation financing bill during the last, Republican-controlled Congress, <a href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=nifea&&sid=aJYp9qLfnHY8">Bush told his Republican colleagues</a> to hold down spending and vowed to veto any bill that had a tax increase for transportation.  The result was a reauthorization bill that will be insufficient for raising essential funds.

The <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070521/news_1n21gastax.html">Democratic-contrlled Congress has been more concerned</a>, but there has been little action on substantively addressing the impending shortfall.  This morning on <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/03/1348236">Democracy Now</a>, Amy Goodman had James Ridgeway on as a guest.  <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/01/highwaymen.html">Ridgeway has written on the current trend towards privatizing public roads</a> and sees the Minnesota tragedy as a possible opportunity for Wall Street capital and large, multinational construction firms to advocate more privatization.  Here in Chicago, for instance, <a href="http://chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=14397&seenIt=1">Mayor Daley leased the Chicago Skyway</a> to a foreign investment firm for 99 years [<a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/transportation/472283,CST-NWS-spend18.article">and he is currently planning on selling Midway Airport</a>].  It resulted in a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/07/AR2007020702134.html">short-term influx of cash</a>, but the long-term impacts of such privatization are unclear.

What should be clear is that the idea that there is not enough public money to support the requisite infrastructure for an advanced industrialized country is suspect.  Given that the country has spent half a billion dollars on a needless war, there really is no excuse for seriously assessing the state of infrastructure and what this means for the health of the country's economy and citizenry.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US Climate Change Update</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A couple of things have happened this week that merit mention in the long, slow, slog towards developing a policy relating to climate change in the US.  On Thursday, conservative senators Joe Lieberman and John Warner introduced the outline for <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/documents/acsa.pdf">"America's Climate Security Act" [.pdf]</a>.  Some key provisions include:

1) Establishment of an EU-style cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions

2) The bill will use 2005 emissions levels as the cap beginning in 2012 and will decrease the number of allowances roughly every ten years until 2050 when emissions would be 70% below the 2005 level.

3) Heavy industry, utilities, and gas and oil refining will be the sectors covered.

4) A Federal agency would be set up to regulate emissions trading

5) A certain percentage of emissions credits will be given free to affected industries each year, with around 20-25% auctioned off.

As far as it goes, its main significance is that it mandates a cap-and-trade system for major US producers.  However, it doesn't appear to match levels of emissions reduction that are currently being discussed in the international community.  <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/news2007/0802-02.htm">Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has a bill</a> with more internationally-mainstream aspirations.  The <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/environment/archives/119344.asp">Seattle Post-Intelligencer's environment blog</a> has more reaction to the Lieberman/Warner bill.
Speaking of the international front to address climate change, the week's other news was that Bush set a date for his unilaterally-declared international conference.  Ignoring the fact that world leaders have been meeting regularly under the auspices of the UN, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/03/AR2007080301906.html">Bush set his conference for September 27-28</a>--just <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/1c81f550-15b5-11dc-a7ce-000b5df10621.html">two days after the UN has scheduled a major meeting on the subject in New York</a>.  While the UN meeting is expected to be attended by over 100 heads of state, Bush is keeping his conference small by inviting only the 15 largest polluting countries along with representatives from the EU and the UN.  It seems problematic that countries with large populations, currently bearing negative impacts from climate change are not part of Bush's conference.

It will be interesting to see how China and India's stance towards the post-Kyoto climate change regime will evolve over the course of the next couple of months.  Bush's has always explained his resistance to Kyoto as being about "fairness" given the fact that India and China are not required to reduce their emissions.  Just this week, however, the finance ministers  at the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Market-solution-for-climate-change-APEC/2007/08/03/1185648134786.html">Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Australia </a>agreed that their countries (which includes China) need to <a href="http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/s1996551.htm">"go beyond" the Kyoto Protocol</a> in a UN-brokered agreement.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/04/AR2007080400915.html?sub=AR">US House of Representatives joined the Senate</a> in passing comprehensive energy legislation this past weekend.  Some of the key highlights:

1) Requires privately-owned utilities to obtain 15% of their energy from renewable [including hydroelectric] sources--although utilities can meet up to 4% of this threashold by introducing certain efficiency measures.
2) Cancelled a series of tax breaks to oil and gas companies approved by the previous Congress

3)  Offered funding for grants and research relating to ethanol production and distribution

The Senate passed its energy legislation in June.  Once Congress returns from its summer recess the bills will be reconciled in conference and then sent to Bush, who has indicated that he will veto the bill.

<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/newsflash/politics/index.ssf?/base/politics-13/1186275660162550.xml&storylist=washington&thispage=1">Key differences between the Senate and House versions</a> include strong fuel efficiency standards for automobiles and SUVs present in the Senate bill.  However, the Senate legislation did not have the requirement for private utilities to generate renewable energy.  Nor does the Senate version have the tax break repeal.

It will be likely that these differences seem likely to be reconciled this Autumn.  It will be interesting to see how Bush responds to the legislation.  Given his low standing in opinion polls--and if Congress is able to time its passage to coincide with Bush's climate change summit in late September--there may be ample political pressure to make a veto difficult for the President.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Toll Wars in Pennsylvania</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On the heels of my post last week providing context to the Minnesota bridge disaster, there is an interesting controversy brewing in Pennsylvania relating to highways, maintenance, and multi-modal transportation policy.  <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07217/807144-147.stm">The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports</a> on the efforts of Pennsylvania's Republican Congressmen John Peterson and Phil English who want to prohibit the state from implementing a <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07207/804588-147.stm">plan passed last month in the state legislature</a> to put tolls on Interstate 80 and use the financing for mass transit and road maintenance.

Peterson and English are trying to amend a large federal financing bill that Congress will take up later in the Autumn to prohibit the tolling.  There is little chance that the Peterson/English amendment will be successful given Democratic control of Congress, but it is interesting to note that Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell threatened to lease the Pennsylvania Turnpike to a private company to raise part of the $950 million needed to fund the state bill.

This is a further example of the bind that states like Pennsylvania are in to both adequately maintain their crumbling highway systems and plan for more integrated transportation systems that are more cost-effective than simply relying on the expensive highway system for regional mobility.

It appears like there are already Pennsylvanians other than Gov. Rendell who are thinking creatively about alternatives to the automobile.  The <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07219/807408-51.stm">Post-Gazette's lead story today focuses on people who kayak to work</a> in the river-rich city of Pittsburgh!  Waterways are horribly under-utilized for mobility in most urban regions of the US.  It is especially surprising given that river transit could be an important component of urban redevelopment.  Here in Chicago, for instance, the Chicago River is popular with tourists; but  the size of its tributaries and their proximity to spaces of population density could make them viable parts of the transportation network.  Countless other cities in the Midwest likely have the same potential.

The Pittsburgh kayakers not only have a small carbon footprint; but they don't have to worry about tolls!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/us/07highway.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin">The front page of the New York Times today features an article</a> on how the contours of the debates relating to federal highway financing may be impacted by last week's bridge collapse in Minneapolis.

The process of "earmarking"--whereby legislators insert into bills financing for specific pet projects in their districts--has come under increased scrutiny.  The article indicates how earmarking tends to result in financing high-profile projects like road openings, new rail lines, etc... rather than the less attractive, but essential, aspects of infrastructure maintenance.  Furthermore, something akin to national priorities list is absent, making the spending of federal funds contingent on a representative's influence in Congress as opposed to objective measurements of need.

While the earmarking process is rather inefficient, there was a more problematic invocation of large transit projects as being "pork" and, hence, something that could be cut.  As the debates over how to deal with crumbling infrastructure develop, it is likely that rail critics will point to public transit as a "waste" given low levels of ridership and the high up-front, capital costs required to develop adequate systems.

It would be unfortunate if these voices dominate these impending debates.  One of the "problems" with transit's viability stems from the fact that land use is locally-controlled and that federal infrastructure financing has not been tied to sensible land use strategies.  A rethinking of how the federal government deals with infrastructure might focus first on tying infrastructure money to "smart growth" strategies.  This could be done by requiring states to prioritize growth regions and funding capital projects that reinforce multiple forms of mobility.  In the long run, maintenance costs will be lower and related problems such as climate change and energy use could be minimized.

This is unlikely to happen in the absence of a political leadership that strives to think creatively about the integrated nature of these varied domestic problems.  But, oftentimes, dramatic and tragic events like the one experienced last week in Minneapolis can spur alternative ways of thinking.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The front page of today's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/23/us/23coal.html?ex=1345521600&en=3d104859e0d4fa55&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">New York Times reports</a> on rules being proposed by the US Interior Department's Office of Surface Mining that will make it easier for coal companies to engage in mountaintop removal mining techniques.

The rules--to be published in tomorrow's Federal Register for public comment--will essentially abolish prohibitions of mining activities in close proximity to stream beds.  From the Administration's perspective, this will clarify the legal obstacles to mountaintop removal.

Mountaintop removal is one of the most environmentally-destructive forms of mining for coal.  It involves the wholesale destruction of a mountain to get to the coal underneath and then proceeding to dump the waste into stream beds.  This results in severe changes to hyrdological patterns and contamination of water supplies.  Furthermore, this type of mining requires less labor than traditional forms of mining.  Communities, in turn, see high levels of unemployment and environmental destruction.

Mountaintop removal has been all the rage in the coal fields of the southern Appalachians.  Communities in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Tennessee will bear the brunt of these new regulations.

There has been <a href="http://www.news-expressky.com/articles/2007/08/22/news/01mining.txt">significant public outcry</a> against these techniques--but it has been rather localized.  Given the fact that much of the electricity in the US is produced in coal-burning plants situated far from coal's sorces makes it difficult for widespread, national concern to develop against this type of mining.

It will be interesting to see how this issue is dealt with in upcoming electoral races.  In Kentucky, where Governor Ernie Fletcher is running for re-election, it could emerge as an important issue.  Fletcher is trying to avoid the issue <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/471/story/156830.html">by focusing on an opposition to a state-wide gambling referendum</a>.

It will also be interesting to see if any of the Democratic presidential candidates are queried on their views.  In particular, Barack Obama has significant support from the coal industry.  How he balances this support with environmentalists' concern with the expansion of mountaintop removal will be interesting.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bali Conference Begins Monday</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Monday, 3 December marks the first major meeting to negotiate the post-Kyoto international agreement on climate change.  Negotiations will be held at the ministerial level beginning on Tuesday, 11 December with the intervening days being filled with background discussion, the presentation of the latest climate change research, and discussions on various mitigation strategies.

Somewhere between 10,000 and 12,000 delegates are scheduled to participate in the two-week affair being held in the Indonesian resort island of Bali. The UN has set up a <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_13/items/4049.php">pretty extensive website</a> providing background materials, links to webcasts, and agendas for the proceedings.

As the meetings proceed, I will provide some commentary and try and highlight significant developments.  With the presidential primary season heating up and the fact that the Bush Administration has a general antipathy towards multilateralism, the US press has been pretty quiet about the conference.

Some brief observations:
<ul>
	<li>First, the politics of symbolism are on full display in Bali.  The <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e0d97324-9f8f-11dc-8031-0000779fd2ac,dwp_uuid=728a07a0-53bc-11db-8a2a-0000779e2340.html">Financial Times reports </a>that the Indonesian government is deploying biofuel-powered buses and <a href="http://www.cyclingdude.com/2007/12/bikes-for-minis.html">bicycles</a> to move delegates around the Nusa Dua resort area.  In the first press briefing of the conference, the head UN official overseeing the talks, Yvo de Boer, announced that the dress code for the will not require Western-style suits.  According to the Chinese news agency, <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-12/02/content_7186708.htm">Xinhua</a>, this would <font id="Zoom"> "allow participants to conduct discussions in a more comfortable environment, as well as limit the use of air conditioning and thereby reduce greenhouse gas emissions."</font>  The <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2007/12/02/eabali102.xml">Telegraph</a> is skeptical of these efforts.</li>
	<li>Changing domestic politics in key countries will have an influence on the proceedings.  Most notably, with the defeat of climate change skeptic John Howard in Australia last week, the new government of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd will provide a fundamental change in orientation and leave the United States with one less ally in its hesitant stance on climate change.  Political theorist <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22857670-7583,00.html">Robyn Eckersley has an interesting commentary</a> on the expectations for Rudd's government in the talks.  The world will also get its first view of former Midnight Oil lead singer, Peter Garrett, as a statesman.  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/australia/story/0,,2219509,00.html">Garrett was given part of the environment portfolio</a> in Rudd's government.</li>
	<li>Finally, it is important to keep in mind that the successor of Kyoto will not be decided in Bali.  In his press briefing today, de Boer essentially said that he would like the final product of Bali to be a commitment to negotiations for a long-term solution to the problem of climate change and a basic agenda and timeline for those discussions.. First, he wants a formal agreement committing countries to discussions for a long-term solution to climate change.  Second, he wants agreement on an agenda for those upcoming discussions. This seems pretty modest--we'll track the progress over the next couple of weeks.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://climatechangeaction.blogspot.com/2007/11/unfccc-bali-climate-conference-audio.html">Climate Change Action</a> has a load of links to other coverage of the happenings in Bali.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Not much happened on the first day of the UN-sponsored climate change talks in Bali.  The opening ceremony featured Indonesian Environment Minister <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-12/03/content_7190417.htm">Rachmat Witolear</a> taking the Presidency of the meetings.  His first order of business was to announce a commemorative stamp issued by the government of Indonesia celebrating the conference.

Later, you get one of those surreal moments that sometimes crop up at these international gatherings.  Witolear invited the Indonesian musician Nugie to debut his song <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-12/03/content_7190782.htm">written especially for the conference</a>, "Share the World."  In one most unconvincing lip-synched performances I've seen in ages, Nugie and his crew of a couple of dozen young "singers" mouth the words in Indonesian to a room
full of bored delegates.  The song is basically a bad rip-off of the 1980s "We Are The World" that was conceived to raise money to stop famine in Africa.  <a href="http://oxfaminternational.wordpress.com/2007/11/15/climate-conference-inspires-a-song/">Oxfam unmercifully posted the song</a> and English translation of the lyrics on their blog.  For a laugh, though, I would look at the weird performance from the <a href="rtsp://webcast.un.org/ondemand/conferences/unfccc/2007/cop/unfccc-071203plen1am-orig.rm">webcast </a>(about 42 minutes in).
On a more "substantive" level, the big news was that <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22865624-11949,00.html">Australia was applauded when its delegate</a> indicated that the country was ratifying Kyoto.  With that pronouncement, the US remains the only major country not to ratify the treaty.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Housing Affordability in US Suburbs--Legislative Responses</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=124</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The current crisis in sub-prime loans in the US is bringing the issue of affordable housing to the forefront of policy agendas in many jurisdictions.  In the US context, issues of affordability in the housing market are generally thought of as a decidedly <em>urban</em> problem.  Suburbs--mostly because of their traditional ability to isolate themselves from issues that affect populations at lower income levels--have been less concerned with affordable housing.  In fact, through zoning policies many suburbs tended to restrict higher-density and rental units that are used in higher proportions by lower income populations.

As home prices skyrocketed over the past decade, however, suburbs are finding that they are not immune from serious issues in the housing supply.  In many communities, lower wage workers and middle-class professionals are priced out of the housing market.  This has an immediate impact on suburban economies as many essential service industry jobs are hard to fill with local employees.  In metropolitan regions with disfunctional transportation systems, people having to commute long distances puts stress on infrastructure and reduces productivity while increasing air pollution and negatively impacting quality of life.

Thus, many suburbs are pursuing changes in policy to address the emerging challenge of affordable housing.  Recently, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/opinion/nyregionopinions/WE1-Housing.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&ref=nyregionopinions&pagewanted=print">New York Times, had an op-ed</a> supporting a new legislative initiative in New York State that would give suburbs money to plan for higher-density development and give municipalities and school districts money for each affordable unit built.  This legislation is incentive-driven rather than regulatory.
It will be interesting to see how it proceeds.  Interestingly, the plan itself was conceived by county executives on Long Island, but the response has been <a href="http://www.libn.com/breakingNews.htm?articleID=9322">less-than-enthusiastic from the Long Island legislative delegation</a>.


In Illinois, we had affordable housing legislation passed in 2005--although I believe that there are no  monetary incentives associated with the legislation.  Rather, the state identified municipalities that did not have a requisite percentage of affordable housing and compelled them to develop a plan to remedy the problem.  <a href="http://www.uic.edu/cuppa/upp/Faculty/people/faculty/hoch.html">Charles Hoch, at UIC</a>, has a <a href="http://www.uic.edu/cuppa/upp/Faculty/people/faculty/Hoch/suburban_response_fulldoc.pdf">working paper</a> (.pdf) on the effectiveness of this approach from the standpoint of the affected municipalities suggesting serious challenges in getting suburbs to comply.

Last year in the suburban Chicago community of Evanston, residents were asked to vote on an increase in the real estate transfer tax which would be put into a fund to support affordable housing.  The referendum failed narrowly, but, interestingly, in a few key lower income precincts support was lacking.   <a href="http://urbanresearchlab.com/housing.aspx">I did a brief analysis of the referendum on my other website</a>.

None of the policy initiatives so far seem to have rectified the issue of affordability.  This is primarily due to the fact that housing allocation is predominantly dictated by market conditions and there has been little political interest in putting funds toward a policy that could sufficiently impact market allocations enough to benefit those sectors of society who are most negatively affected by the current housing crisis.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10480116">New Zealand Herald is reporting</a> that the Ministry of Transport is investigating the possibility of introducing a congestion charge in Auckland to reduce air-quality problems and encourage people to take public transport.

London was the first major city to institute such a scheme.  The article talks about the failed effort in Edinburgh in 2005 to pass a congestion charge referendum and last year's <a href="http://www.stockholmsforsoket.se/">successful referendum in Stockholm</a>.  It is unclear how or if a referendum would take place in the Auckland.

The fact that political leaders and critics are citing the European efforts poses interesting questions into the global diffusion of local policy ideas.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Der Spiegel: US, China &#038; India Will Secretly Derail Climate Talks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The German magazine, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,521153,00.html">Der Spiegel, just posted an interesting article</a> based on anonymous sources indicating that the US is trying to discreetly come to an agreement with China and India in Bali over the next two weeks to NOT come to an agreement on future climate talks.

The article contends that with Australia's embrace of Kyoto yesterday, the US has lost a key ally in resistance to Kyoto.  Publicly, the Bush Administration has said that China and India have to agree to emissions reductions post-Kyoto, while the latter countries have basically said they would consider it if the US agrees first.
The article contends that the US does not want to be seen as scuttling a deal--thus if they could persuade both India and China to be intransigent in their positions, all three countries will come out ahead!

It is hard to give this story too much credence since it is based on anonymous sources, but if the Bali meeting concludes without a substantive agreement, there may be something to it.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bali Climate Change Conference: Day Two</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Things are just getting rolling in Bali.  This week will primarily be comprised of lower-level meetings which will culminate in a set of recommendations for the "roadmap" that will be negotiated next week when higher ranking ministers develop the final template for the content and timeline of post-Kyoto negotiations.

I just got finished watching Yvo de Boer's (the UN climate point-man) <a href="rtsp://webcast.un.org/ondemand/conferences/unfccc/2007/pc/unfccc071204pc5-orig.rm">press conference</a>.  He was trying to pitch the significance of deforestation as an issue and expressed optimism that it will be discussed at the ministerial level next week with regards to implementation of mitigation strategies.  Deforestation is a major issue for developing countries since forests act as carbon sinks and most threatened forests are in poverty-stricken equatorial regions.  Destruction of forests contributes to about 20% of greenhouse gas emissions--the second-largest source.

Forest protection is mentioned in the Kyoto agreement, but its centrality is not apparent.  Enhancing forest protection will likely be on the agenda for the successor agreement.  <a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22864753-664,00.html">Sir Richard Branson--chairman of the Virgin Group--asserted yesterday</a> that multinationals and developed countries would pay for forest protection.  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2007/12/03/eaforest103.xml">The Telegraph has a report</a> on a study by the <a href="http://www.asb.cgiar.org/">Partnership for Tropical Forest Margins</a> that asserts that deforestation brings in $1-5 per ton of carbon released while the price for a ton of carbon offsets is going <a href="http://www.pointcarbon.com/">for around $32</a>.  Expanding the offset market could be used, perhaps, to create incentives for keeping forests intact.

Other news from Bali.  A Yes Men-style hoax was <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/news/2007/12/climate_hoax_qa">perpetrated yesterday</a> when an environmental group sent out a fake press release from the US energy industry group, US Climate Partnership, announcing that their members would reduce emissions by a huge 90%!    Some <a href="http://itsgettinghotinhere.org/2007/12/03/us-cap-commits-to-90-reduction-by-2050-coal-moratorium/">blogs</a> as well as the Dallas Morning News published the report before uncovering that it was a prank.

On non-prank news, many activists have descended on Bali to get their grievances heard.  The <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20071203-1055-bali-sinkingislands.html">San Diego Union Tribune has an article</a> on refugees from climate change who came to Bali.  Some <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view_article.php?article_id=104850">activists have been deported</a> by the heavy-handed Indonesian government, including representatives from the <a href="http://www.no-burn.org/">Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives</a>.

Inside the conference, numerous side events took place by NGOs, including one by the US environmental group, Sierra Club that looked at the group's <a href="http://coolcities.us/">Cool Cities</a> campaign which pushes cities to sign on to GHG emissions reductions schemes.  The <a href="http://www.ciel.org/">Center for International Environmental Law </a>held a forum looking at human rights issues facing Arctic indigenous communities as a result of climate change.  <a href="http://www.un.org/webcast/unfccc/2007/index.asp?go=06071203">Webcasts of those forums</a> are available on the UN site.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bali Climate Change Conference: Day Three</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=128</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At this point in the conference, the Conference of the Parties--meaning representatives all of the countries that are parties to Kyoto--has developed various working groups on issues of technology transfer, implementation of clean development, and other related issues.  These groups meet informally for the rest of the week and develop an agenda for ministers to discuss next week.

Thus, most of the news coming out of Bali today is confined to reporting the jockeying for position by the various state interests, and significant NGO lobbying.  On the issue of various state interests, the breakdown is pretty simple.   Most developing countries are concerned with immediate action taken on the issue of adaptation.  They are facing serious problems associated with climate change, such as desertification, dealing with drought and water supply, as well as rising sea levels.  These countries are also interested in seeing more resources placed on the subsidized transfer of green technologies.

The United States and a handful of other "foot-draggers" (including Canada) have been pretty silent.  The <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/oes/rls/rm/2007/96155.htm">briefing</a> by the head of the US delegation, Harlan Watson, is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/04/AR2005120400891.html">typical of US behavior at previous conferences</a>: the US expresses its "commitment" to reducing emissions, but is unwilling to commit to binding changes.

The European Union, on the other hand, has been much more specific.  Yesterday <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/dec2007/gb2007124_968205.htm?chan=globalbiz_europe+index+page_top+stories">it was reported</a> that the EU will reduce its emissions by 50% from 1990 levels by 2050.  Under Kyoto, they have committed to reductions by 20% by 2020.

Activists, however, are still skeptical.  The Climate Action Network's <a href="http://www.un.org/webcast/unfccc/2007/index.asp?go=05071205">press conference today</a> gave an indication of the frustration stemming from grassroots communities.  CAN is an international coalition of local and national groups dealing with climate change effects.  The message of their press conference was that the lack of specific emission reduction plans discussed by the countries thus far was problematic and will result in further suffering by largely poor countries and communities.

Other interesting tidbits:
<ul>
	<li>For an example of particular problems facing developing countries, <a href="http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/html/20071204T220000-0500_130050_OBS_JAMAICA_SEEKS_FUNDING_FOR_PROBLEMATIC_AIRPORT_ROAD.asp">check out this article</a> in the Jamaica Observer which discusses how the country needs crucial development help to repair infrastructure being compromised by climate change.  It exemplifies the need for urgent money for adaptation being pressed for by many countries.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSPEK2535220071205">Chinese are arguing for a new development fund</a> that would provide money for green technology.  Given the US stance that China should have to reduce emissions if the US is asked to, this could be an initial bargaining chip for future negotiations.</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/12/making-deforest.html">Indonesia has announced</a> a scheme to to combat deforestation by paying people not to cut down trees.  The Indonesian delegation talks about the plan in their <a href="rtsp://webcast.un.org/ondemand/conferences/unfccc/2007/pc/unfccc071205pc4-orig.rm">webcast</a>.</li>
	<li>Australian Prime Minister <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/washington-told-its-time-to-join-the-kyoto-party/2007/12/05/1196812824833.html">Kevin Rudd encourages Bush</a> to ratify Kyoto.</li>

		<title>US Senate Committee Passes Lieberman-Warner Climate Change Bill</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the high-profile UN climate change conference reaching its half-way point in Bali, the key environment committee in the Democratic-controlled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/washington/06energy.html?ex=1354597200&en=8dbda8bd08ac826b&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">Senate passed a bill yesterday</a> that would require 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  The bill (S. 2191) now goes to the Senate floor where the Republican minority--led by climate change denier James Inhofe--<a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/06/america/Global-Warming-Senate.php">promises to filibuster </a>the bill.

The Lieberman-Warner bill would <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/12/06/MNIBTP0QH.DTL">introduce a cap-and-trade program</a> with emissions credits first being given to industrial emitters (like power plants) and, later, being auctioned.  The bill also introduces a nationwide low-carbon fuel standard that requires a 10% cut in the carbon content of fuel by 2020.

On the whole, the bill is pretty modest by international standards.  An amendment by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont which would require an 80% cut in emissions by 2050 was defeated.  This 80% number is emerging as the scientific consensus and has been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2219534,00.html">advocated by economists such as Sir Nicholas Stern</a>.

It is unlikely that the bill will be taken up until after the new year.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thursday was taken up with lower-level informal discussions in anticipation of developing an agenda for next week's minsterial meetings.  Thus, there was not much news from the negotiators.  Many, NGOs and other advocacy groups, however, took the opportunity to assert their views in an attempt to influence negotiations.

Some key developments:
<ul>
	<li>A group of around 200 climate scientists--many of whom were involved in the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>--released the <a href="http://www.climate.unsw.edu.au/bali/">Bali Climate Declaration by Scientists</a>.  The IPCC provides scientific evidence on anthropogenic climate change.  Yesterday's declaration was more policy-oriented.  <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/climatefeedback/2007/12/scientists_speak_out_in_bali.html">The scientists argue</a> that global warming must be limited to 2 degree centigrade from pre-industrial levels and global GHG emissions must be reduced by 50% from 1990 levels by 2020.</li>
	<li>In his second press conference of the week (<a href="rtsp://webcast.un.org/ondemand/conferences/unfccc/2007/pc/unfccc071206pc7-orig.rm">webcast</a>), lead US negotiator Harlan Watson rambled for about five minutes on a topic essentially unrelated to the UN negotiations until announcing that the US-sponsored meetings of the major economies will continue next month.  He asserted that neither the meetings in Bali nor next month's discussions will have the issue of specific binding emissions reductions on the table.  When pressed about the Bali Climate Declaration by Scientists, he claimed he didn't know about it.  With the lack of clarity coming from the Administration, it is becoming more clear that Bush's strategy is to dodge and weave until he's out office, leaving his successor to deal with climate change policy.</li>
	<li><a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/climate-panel-may-not-have-time-to-celebrate/">According to the New York Times' environment blog</a>, UN climate chief Yvo de Boers indicated that IPCC scientific assessments should be more frequent than the customary 5-6 intervals.  It will be interesting to see this issue discussed at tomorrow's plenary on the IPCC reporting process.  The plenary is scheduled to be <a href="http://www.un.org/webcast/unfccc/index.asp">webcast beginning at 3pm Bali time</a>.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iAZIAg8Y32rASB1Z3BgehnjOzlEgD8TBF4T00">Japanese delegation released some ideas</a> for the post-Bali negotiations that conspicuously omitted mention of binding targets for emissions.  Environmentalists criticized the proposal, but the Japanese defended it as a way of getting the US into discussions.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first week of the UN-sponsored climate change conference in Bali is coming to a close.  I haven't yet had a chance to look at the various webcasts from Friday's sessions so this update will focus on some of the reporting.  The main official session on Friday consisted of an update from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  This is the Nobel Prize winning scientific commission that has spent the last 16 months, or so, reviewing the scientific literature on climate change.  They issued their latest, <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-syr.htm">"synthesis," report</a> last month.  The report asserts unequivocally that the earth is indeed warming and that this is due to human activity.  I am assuming that today's session is essentially a replication of the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/">briefing done last month in Valencia</a> by the IPCC.  The Bali webcast page has some of the <a href="http://www.un.org/webcast/unfccc/2007/index.asp?go=1000">relevant documents</a> from today's presentation.

In other news from Bali:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/12/07/bali_climate_conference/">Salon has a good article on the skepticism of the US position</a> by activists at Bali.  The general consensus is that the US is rhetorically supporting multilateral negotiations--which is the goal of Bali-but has given little indication that it is interested in agreeing to binding action on emissions reduction.</li>
	<li><a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gPXYXLtHpHBg6-68yJHoJyXGT1zA">Yvo de Boers said</a> that it is unlikely that developing countries will support mandatory emissions reduction.  He described India as not being <a href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/154750.html">"very strong in the forefront of discussions."</a></li>
	<li>Meanwhile, the leaders of various countries are giving their delegations marching orders as ministers prepare to meet next week.  <a href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/154750.html">In India, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</a> has said the country will not agree to any restrictions that might harm the country's growth rate.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Saturday's official deliberations at the Bali conference were limited to the continuation of discussions by working groups to develop an agenda for the beginning of ministerial meetings on Tuesday.  <a href="http://www.un.org/webcast/unfccc/2007/index.asp?go=05071208">At the press conference</a> marking the halfway point in the conference, UN climate change chief Yvo de Boers made some interesting observations.

First, he noted the strong resistance for binding emissions reductions on the part of developing countries.  This will likely cause friction as industrialized countries such as <a href="http://www.un.org/webcast/unfccc/2007/index.asp?go=05071208">Australia</a>, <a href="http://mdn.mainichi.jp/national/news/20071205p2a00m0na013000c.html">Japan</a>, and <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hjgJAYTz1867ZFCzP0IQIDnFdDcA">Canada </a>have been pushing India and China to make binding cuts.

Second, <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070035335&ch=12/8/2007%206:55:00%20PM">de Boers is worried </a>that if too many specifics are on next week's agenda, the ministers may recoil and talks could be scuttled.  He reasserted his goal of Bali producing a commitment to continued talks, a general agenda for such talks, and a delimited time line for their completion.  However, in a response to a question on emissions targets that had been mentioned in the IPCC report, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=aJEjnlfV2tGg&refer=europe">he intimated that having a particular goal of around 40% </a>GHG emission reduction from 1990 levels by 2020 would be useful as part of the agenda to go forward.

Other climate policy-related news from Bali and elsewhere:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL0728763120071207">Carbon traders apparently are optimistic</a> that a strong cap-and-trade regime will emerge in the post-Kyoto agreement if the run on carbon futures are any indication.</li>
	<li>There are marches going on all over the world protesting inaction on climate change.  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uklatest/story/0,,-7137530,00.html">More than 10,000 people marched in London</a>.</li>
	<li>The Indonesian delegation at Bali <a href="http://www.antara.co.id/en/arc/2007/12/8/ri-to-bring-up-marine-resources-carbon-absorbing-capcity-at-unfccc/">will be proposing</a> an in-depth consideration of the carbon absorption capacities of marine resources at the ministerial meetings.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.sidsnet.org/aosis/">Alliance of Small Island States</a> <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/climate/index.php?menu=stories&detail=106">asserted the urgent need</a> for adaptation funds from industrialized countries to help them deal with the immediate problems of rising sea levels and erosion.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The UN-sponsored climate talks were in recess today, but there are still some interesting media reports coming out of Bali.

<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1210/p07s02-wogi.html">The Christian Science Monitor has a good story</a> on some of the shortcomings of Kyoto, but also previews the draft document that will be the basis for this week's minsterial talks.  Interestingly, the preamble asserts that industrialized countries should reduce GHG emissions by 20-40% from 1990 levels by 2020.  The US has already rejected such specifics, so it will be interesting to see how the delegation responds if the 20-40% number remains in the document after discussions tomorrow and Tuesday.

<a href="http://www.livemint.com/2007/12/10002431/Efforts-to-thrash-out-blueprin.html">The Hindustan Times talks to some of the Indian delegates off the record</a> to give a glimpse of where the talks are headed from a developing country perspective.  Unsurprisingly, the sentiment expressed in the article is that, as long as big emitters such as Japan, Canada and the US are unwilling to budge on increased binding emissions reductions without developing country participation, countries such as India are likely to point out that their per-capita emissions are so low that matters of equity require them to be exempt.

To offer a little perspective on the variety of positions coming from the developing world, see <a href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/155251.html">Joydeep Gupta's comparison of India and China</a>.  Gupta characterizes China as being much more pragmatic and proactive in reducing its own emissions.  Even though both countries are against binding emissions for developing countries, China's approach may give them a better negotiating position as opposed to India's recalcitrance.

Tomorrow, <a href="http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/1209/climate.html">Al Gore</a> and IPCC chair <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a485ca66-9c75-11dc-bcd8-0000779fd2ac.html">Rajendra Pachauri</a> will <a href="http://nobelprize.org/award_ceremonies/lectures_2007.html">accept their Nobel Peace prize</a> before going to Bali later in the week.  <a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2006/9/18/154846/236">Gore has been arguing for a global carbon tax</a> as a way to develop a revenue stream to offset the real costs of climate change.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Draft Declaration Released in Bali</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/12/10/2113861.htm?section=world">The Australian Broadcasting Corporation is reporting that the UN has released a draft declaration</a> to be delivered to ministers at the Bali talks on Wednesday.

I was unable to find a copy online, but the ABC report indicates that the declaration "called on developing countries to recognize the need to limit or reduce emissions."  It apparently also includes the 20-40% industrialized country GHG reduction target by 2020 that I discussed earlier.

The ultimate goal is to insure that a 2 degree increase in global temperatures is avoided.

From this brief report, it looks as if the delegates will be using the <a href="http://ecologyandpolicy.blogspot.com/2007/11/ipcc-synthesis-report.html">IPCC synthesis report</a> as its basis for the talks.  This is not unexpected--but given the intransigent positions of some of the major countries on reductions (China, US, India, Canada, and Japan) it will be interesting to see the reactions later in the week.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Toronto Star on Crazy American Commuting Habits</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Canadian press oftentimes likes to look at its southern neighbor with bemusement and bewilderment.
The latest example of this comes from the <a href="http://www.thestar.com/printArticle/283771">Toronto Star's Washington editor</a> who looks at the phenomenon of commuting in the Washington DC area.  They profile a person who commutes 244km from extreme western Virginia to a DC suburb for work.  While this distance is pretty extreme, it reflects growing trend of longer commute times and the lost productivity and leisure that comes with the spatial segregation of affordable housing and employment centers.  This is exacerbated by a mobility monoculture that offers no alternative to the automobile.

<a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/World/article/283890">Interestingly, the Star's London bureau chief gives a similar story of a long commute</a> in the British capital--this time involving train travel.  London Mayor Ken Livingstone's congestion charging scheme made it more expensive for London's commuters to drive into the central city causing an increase in ridership with concomitant train delays and crowded, uncomfortable rides.  The person profiled in the London piece travels 60km, and has about a 90 minute commute.

These two stories offer interesting points of comparison.  While the London commuter has more mobility options, the total commute time is similar for a shorter distance.  Issues of affordable housing and quality of life preferences certainly figure in to each case--as well as the social costs and benefits of each form of mobility.

The Star is continuing the series on commuting in various cities around the world all week with dispatches from Israel, Beijing and Palestine.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UK to Build 25gw of Wind Generation Capacity by 2020</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[According to <a href="http://environment.independent.co.uk/green_living/article3236132.ece">the Independent</a>, the British commerce minister will announce tomorrow that the United Kingdom will build enough offshore wind farms by 2020 to meet the country's residential power needs.

Apparently the minister, John Hutton, had privately advised Prime Minister Gordon Brown to focus on nuclear expansion rather than renewables.  Thus, this announcement will come as a bit of a reversal.

The sites for the wind farms still need to be determined, but the Independent reported that the government anticipates less resistance if they are situated offshore.

With the British announcement, I anticipate that many other countries will make bold pronouncements to build their green credentials as the Bali ministerial meetings begin on Wednesday.

In fact, Norway, <a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2143875.ece">has just announced a major initiative</a> to protect rainforests in developing countries, on the eve of the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony tomorrow.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Higher level delegations began to arrive in Bali in advance of the ministerial meetings on Wednesday.  Over the weekend a draft document was developed to guide discussions.  It included a provision for quantified emissions reductions--<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2007/12/10/eabali210.xml">which is a non-starter for the US</a>.

Other tidbits:
<ul>
	<li>In his press conference today, UN climate change chief, Yvo de Boers, called out Canada for being hypocritical.  The Canadian delegation has been one of the most vocal in demanding that developing countries agree to binding emissions, but they also announced that Canada has not met its own reductions commitment under Kyoto.</li>
	<li>de Boers also defended the importance of discussing quantifiable emissions reductions in Bali (the draft proposal calls on industrialized countries to reduce emissions between 20-30% from 1990 levels by 2020).  His argued that the science shows that immediate action is necessary and that it is difficult for the private sector to invest in technological development during a period of uncertainty.  If emissions numbers were known, private corporations and utilities could make requisite modifications in new construction and maintenance.  This is especially important in fast-growing economies, such as China's, where new coal-fired power plants are being put on line weekly.</li>
	<li>The US delegate Harlan Watson rejected agreement to emissions reduction commitments at Bali because they could "prejudice outcomes" for future negotiations.</li>
	<li>Interestingly, US Senator John Kerry--while critical of the Bush Administration's stance--also urged a degree of measured patience at the talks.  He revisited the failure of Kyoto in the US Senate in the late 1990s and argued that it would have passed had the agenda at Kyoto included all countries in the world for some level of emission reduction.  He argued that the set of meetings held in advance of Kyoto took that option off the table and that it ultimately made it impossible for the US Senate to pass.</li>
	<li>Kerry, however, was impressive in his press conference, saying that his presence was intended to show the international community that there is a strong commitment to addressing climate change in the US even if the Bush Administration is agnostic on the subject.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ministers arrived in Bali today for two days of speeches and negotiations with the ultimate outcome being a "road map" for two years of negotiation culminating in a post-Kyoto climate change agreement.

The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/12/AR2007121200478.html?sub=AR">US position resisting specific numbers on emission reduction was hardened today</a> as the lead negotiator from the State Department, Paula Dobriansky, and Bush's main environmental adviser, James Connaughton, arrived in Bali.  Their press conference was a lesson in obfuscation.  Dobriansky read a prepared statement that spent a considerable amount of time naming all of the members of the administration's delegation and very little on the substance of the negotiations.

On a more positive front, it seems as if <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2007/12/11/eabali111.xml">the "Roadmap" will have an element on deforestation</a>.  <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4bf5f428-a857-11dc-9485-0000779fd2ac.html">Fiona Harvey of the Financial Times discusses some of the challenges </a>with measuring carbon saved from keeping forests intact and how a scheme that would entail financial transfers from the industrialized countries to the developing world would operate.

<a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20071224/wysham">The Nation's Daphne Wysham has a very interesting critique</a> of the forestation schemes being discussed.  She approaches it with skepticism, arguing that the linkage of carbon trading as a way of raising money for forest projects (something Yvo de Boer has suggested as a possibility) is going to further erode the sovereignty of developed countries as their "forest capital" could be leveraged to further indebtedness.  Furthermore, a market-based financial incentive may trump the ecological benefits of forest preservation.  Given the fact that forest destruction in many developing countries is currently illegal, the problem of monitoring effectiveness seems challenging.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Maybe we are going about this thing all wrong -- trying to attack the many arms of the Climate Change problem instead of going for its eye.

On the face of it, Climate Change is a problem of excess CO2 emissions. But analyse deeper, and one finds that it's a problem of overconsumption by all of us, individuals, corporates, government.

Analyse still deeper, and one finds that overconsumption is triggered by and funded by CREDIT. There is an overabundance of bank credit -- far out of proportion to actual earnings and savings -- that gives people the power to overspend and overconsume.

So this is where the cancerous tumour, so to speak, can be clearly isolated from human flesh. This is where we can start cutting away surgically, methodically, without hurting too many people.

CONSUMER CREDIT -- loans extended by banks for purchase of new vehicles and consumer appliances -- is a major artery feeding this tumour. Easy loans warp our purchasing decisions, making our desires seem like needs.

Two calls from an aggressive marketer of car loans is all I need to make me feel that I NEED to step up from my family car to an SUV.

CREDIT CARDS make one feel really wealthy, by enabling one to securely carry large amounts equivalent to many months' earnings in the wallet.

And when you do that, you are potentially able to do all those wonderful, beautiful, generous things that you see in TV commercials like buying your wife a diamond solitaire, booking the Presidential suite for your wedding anniversary or surprising her with a couple of air-tickets to Paris.

Consumer credit and credit-cards are the hot air causing the great big Economic Growth balloon to go up... and up... and up.

Driven by this excessive consumer demand, a number of industries flourish, new corporates are created, and new factories get built, diversified, expanded, acquired... We aren't only borrowing economically, we are borrowing ecologically.

Suggested line of action: At an individual level, we should stop buying things with credit, and stop using our credit cards. It is worth cutting up our credit cards. Let us stop borrowing from the future.

And as a community of concerned citizens, let us lobby for a clampdown on consumer credit. Let us write to the government, to our Central Banks and to individual banks and bankers.

Let each person in the banking industry be targetted with this message: Cap and roll back. Let us ask for a freeze of consumer credit at current levels this year, and a 50% reduction in the amounts of credit given each year.

This would give the economy about three years to adjust to the changing scenario.

Three years is 36 months -- far more time than the economy and its stakeholders get for adjustment when the stock-markets crash. So why delay, postpone and vacillate?

Warmly,
Krishnaraj Rao

The index ranks countries according to a host of environmental criteria ranging from environmental health to climate change policy and water and air pollution.  Given the dynamic nature of environmental problems, the weight given to various aspects of environmental policy fluctuates from year to year.

This year, the United States ranks 39th in the world, behind most of the EU member countries and other unlikely candidates such as the Dominican Republic, Georgia, Russia, and Panama.  The killer for the US is that more weight is placed on climate change policy than other areas.

The report was issued at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.  The WEF will have numerous panels on environmental issues--many of which will be <a href="http://gaia.world-television.com/wef/worldeconomicforum%5Fannualmeeting2008/default.aspx">webcast</a>, including <a href="http://gaia.world-television.com/wef/worldeconomicforum%5Fannualmeeting2008/default.aspx?sn=24157&lang=en">Thursday's event on climate change</a> featuring Bono and Al Gore!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>EPA Administrator Defies Logic, Denies California&#039;s Rights Under the Clean Air Act</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month, the US Environmental Protection Agency denied the State of California's application to determine its own greenhouse emissions standards for automobiles and other vehicles.  Yesterday, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/24/AR2008012402424.html">the EPA Administrator, Stephen Johnson, testified before the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee</a> in an attempt to explain his decision.

When the Clean Air Act was passed in 1966, <a href="ttp://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2007/12/12/california_vs_the_auto_industry/index.html">California was given an exemption</a> to use stricter standards for emission than the federal ones determined by the EPA.  Bush's EPA--under Johnson's authority--surprisingly ignored this provision and <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1697442,00.html">denied California's application</a>.  The law requires that the state apply for an exemption to assert its authority, but in past years the EPA has generally given blanket approval.

<a href="http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=dc9b6b66-74d7-431b-be4c-699c8f30af9f">Johnson's explanation</a> [.pdf] for not following the letter of the law and the agency's precedent was that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to a problem that is "fundamentally global in nature" and, hence "not exclusive to California and differs in a basic way from the previous local and regional air pollution problems addressed in prior waivers."

Essentially Johnson is saying that since GHG emissions contribute to global environmental problems and are not restricted to the state of California, there is no need for them to reduce emissions.   Ultimately, the logic of Johnson leads to a denial of the affects of global warming in the state.  This is particularly galling given <a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/01/epa-chief-cooke.html">the fact that EPA staff laid out a strong case</a> for the impact of global warming on California.
Vermont senator, <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/005131.php">Bernie Sanders, expressed exasperation </a>and failed to get Johnson to acknowledge the seriousness of climate change.  It will be interesting to see how this impacts the "major economies" meeting convened by the White House in Hawaii next week to discuss global warming--particularly if European Union representatives push stronger for US commitment to a GHG reduction scheme.

In the interim, Senator Barbara Boxer has introduced legislation that will overturn Johnson's decision.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Japanese Prime Minster Yasuo Fukuda Announces Global Climate Change Proposal</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=141</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Japanese Prime Minster Yasuo Fukuda presented a <a href="http://www.weforum.org/pdf/PM_Japan_Speech_260108.pdf">proposal </a>[.pdf] to push global climate change talks to the next level.

Fukuda is this year's chair of the G-8 and will be pushing the proposal at the annual meeting of G-8 leaders to take place in July.  The proposal has two major elements: embracing the IPCC goal of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050 and establishing a $10 billion (US) fund for adaptation efforts in the developing world.  He also asserted the need to establish a global adaptation and mitigation fund.

Fukuda's announcement at Davos is significant because <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/05/asia/AS-GEN-Bali-Japan-Gambit.php">Japan was considered to be dragging its feet </a>at last month's UN meetings in Bali over specific targets for GHG emissions.  Fukuda's speech seems to suggest that Japan is interested in reasserting global leadership on the issue.

Fukuda's speech comes on the heels of next week's "major economies" conference on global warming sponsored by the United States.  In today's Wall Street Journal, James Connaughton, the chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120130867021618417.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">has an op-ed piece</a> laying out "the Bush plan for Climate Change."  The piece is extremely thin on specifics for a post-Kyoto reductions regime.

In <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/01/20080125-2.html">a press briefing yesterday</a>, Connaughton was asked about some specifics relating to global binding targets and a domestic cap-and-trade system and he failed to offer any clarity as to the administration's view.

As the administrations' partners in obfuscation start to develop more specific proposals, it is likely that the US will be under significant pressure to acquiesce to the developing global consensus.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Dave LeBlanc, the architecture critic from the Globe and Mail, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080125.ARCHI25/TPStory/Environment">asserts</a> that environmentalism and green architecture will be much more successful as a mass movement if aesthetics are given as much attention by advocates than the scientific facts of cost savings and emission reductions.

It is an interesting argument given the realities of consumer capitalism and the absence of political will in many Western countries to initiate adequate environmentally-oriented regulatory regimes.

The Canadian designer <a href="http://www.brucemaudesign.com/index.html">Bruce Mau</a> explored these possibilities in his <a href="http://www.inhabitat.com/2006/10/14/massive-change-exhibition-in-chicago/">Massive Change</a> project--that was exhibited here in Chicago in 2006.  Mau and a panel of other architects and artists are <a href="http://www.brucemaudesign.com/events.html">taking up the subject again next month (Feb. 17) </a>at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year the leaders of the member countries of the European Union agreed to reducing CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020 and by 30% if a global agreement is developed.  Earlier this week <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/focus/energy-package-2008/index_en.htm">European Union President Jose Manuel Barroso presented</a> the details of allocations for each member countries and some more details about implementation to the European Parliament, which will have to support the measures.

In addition to the emissions targets, there is also a requirement that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/23/AR2008012303381.html">20% of energy comes from renewable sources</a>.  The plan has been <a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23100425-1702,00.html">criticized by environmentalists</a> for not going far enough and by <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3086606,00.html">businesses for being too burdensome</a>.

In Britain, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml;jsessionid=XX0VXSS2FCUFJQFIQMFSFFWAVCBQ0IV0?xml=/earth/2008/01/22/eaeu122.xml">40% of the country's electricity will need to come from renewable sources</a>--up from the current level of 5%.   This will undoubtedly cause political discord given the growing power of regional governments--like the Scottish Parliament--whose geography may be advantageous for wind power development, but who may be less inclined to support the radical changes required on their local landscapes.  The <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/wind-farm-plan-is-blown-off-course-774277.html">Independent offers a glimpse</a> into these battles in a feature today on Scottish opposition to a wind farm proposed for the Isle of Lewis.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tomorrow marks the second meeting of the world's major economies convened by US President George Bush to discuss the problem of global climate change.

Given the fact that last month's UN-sponsored talks in Bali nearly imploded as a result of US intransigence, it will be interesting to see how the two-day talks this week play out.  The US administration is still unwilling to sign on to mandatory cuts of greenhouse gas emissions.  In last night's <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/01/20080128-13.html">State of the Union</a> speech, Bush mentioned climate change but was quite unambitious in his goal: "complete an international agreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases."  The "potential" bit was picked up by <a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/29/bali-to-hawaii-the-climate-caravan-moves-on/">New York Times environmental correspondent, Andrew Revkin</a>, as being indicative of a real lowering of expectations in advance of the Hawaii meetings.

UN Climate Change head, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/feedarticle?id=7264669">Yvo de Boer, is interested in action</a>, asserting the need for limiting GHGs to "move into higher gear.  Representatives of <a href="http://nation.ittefaq.com/issues/2008/01/30/news0376.htm">civil society groups in the Global South, meanwhile, are skeptical</a> of the possibility that the US-sponsored talks could eclipse the UN process.

The Azerbaijani website, <a href="http://news.trend.az/index.shtml?show=news&newsid=1122384&lang=EN">Trend, is reporting</a> that many countries are not even sending their ranking environmental ministers to Hawaii, implying that countries of the EU, in particular, don't expect any dramatic breakthroughs from the meeting.

<a href="http://starbulletin.com/2008/01/28/editorial/commentary.html">Environmental activists from Hawaii have an interesting editorial</a> in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin commenting on the real challenges islands like Hawaii face as the planet warms.  They also provide a <a href="http://www.lifeofthelandhawaii.org/MEM/Hawaii_Events.html">link for the schedule</a> of official events related to the talks as well as civil society meetings and protests.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Microsoft Signs On to Help Develop Korean Eco-Techno-Neoliberal-Utopia</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have had a long-standing research interest in the phenomenon of planned communities so its not surprising that I have been following the development of <a href="http://www.songdo.com/">Songdo</a>--the most expensive private real estate development in history.  Located about 70 kilometers southwest of Seoul, the city has its genesis in the country's <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/oth/korea.htm">IMF-mandated economic restructuring</a> following the devaluation of the won in 1997.

One of the IMF's requirements was that Korea increase the capacity for receiving foreign direct investment, allowing for exogenous capital flows to jump-start the economy.  Songdo was conceived as a response to these mandates.  Situated in an <a href="http://www.citymayors.com/development/korea_newcities.html">"economic free trade zone,"  </a>and having English promoted as the dominant language, it is an entirely new city constructed primarily by the US developer, <a href="http://www.galeintl.com/">Gale International</a>.

At full build-out in 2012 Songdo will have 60,000 residents.  It also has ambitions to be a "green" and "ubiquitous" city wherein life for residents is fully networked.  It is this latter element that must have attracted Microsoft, which signed a memorandum of understanding develop technology training in various institutions in the city.  Interestingly, <a href="http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?bicode=020000&biid=2008012825768">the Korean news site, Donga, reports</a> that Gale Chairman Stan Gale says Microsoft wants to turn Songdo into a "model city of the future."

Is Bill Gates following the well worn path of corporate utopianism pioneered by George Pullman and Walt Disney?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Major Economies Climate Talks Commence in Hawaii--Nobody Notices</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=146</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday was the first day of meetings in Hawaii of the world's major economies convened by US President Bush.  There is very little coverage in the press regarding what specifics were discussed or even the general tenor of the meeting.  In fact, at the time of this writing, the US State Department website doesn't even provide an agenda of the proceedings.

According to some <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-01/31/content_7536117.htm">reports</a>, the US is seeing this meeting as a way of mending fences with its allies and the general world community who took US delegates to task at last month's UN meeting in Bali.  In <a href="http://starbulletin.com/2008/01/31/news/story01.html">Bali, the EU threatened to boycott</a> the Hawaii talks if the US failed to agree to a 25-40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2020.  The US did not embrace the reduction, but the EU did not follow through on its threat.

Given the public nature of the US-EU showdown last month, perhaps the lack of news yesterday is an indication that some serious negotiations are occurring.  Conversely, the EU could also be biding time for a new administration in Washington that may be more pragmatic in negotiations.

The ever-diplomatic UN climate change head, <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2208587/tensions-ease-climate">Yvo de Boer, was quoted as saying</a> that there has been a shift in the mood of negotiations, suggesting that the US may be moving away from its recalcitrance.

Otherwise, most of the reporting from Hawaii centered around activist communities registering their impatience with the pace of negotiations as well as Hawaiian political leaders expressing their concern with the issue of climate change.  On the former theme, activists in <a href="http://news.smh.com.au/australia-must-push-us-on-carbon-cuts/20080131-1p7z.html">Australia encouraged</a> climate change minister Penny Wong to push for action and <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUKN3024496120080131?pageNumber=3&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">Reuters reports</a> that there were a handful of protesters at the East-West Center where the talks were taking place.

Hawaii's governor, <a href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/180831,hawaiis-governor-calls-for-agreement-on-climate-change--summary.html">Linda Lingle urged the delegates</a> to bridge their differences while Honolulu mayor, <a href="http://starbulletin.com/2008/01/31/editorial/commentary.html">Mufi Hannemann, reports</a> on his support of the the US Conference of Mayors commitment to address climate change.

Finally, the <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/environment/2008/01/31/hawaii-venice-of-the-pacific/">Reuters environmental blog reports</a> that nature itself may be making a statement as Hawaii is experiencing rare winter storm advisories and many of the beach-front hotels are putting up sandbags in anticipation of protecting the beach from storm swells.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hawaii Climate Change Talks End</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The second day of the US-sponsored Major Economies meeting on climate change ended yesterday without any agreements. <a href="http://starbulletin.com/2008/02/01/news/story04.html"> According to the Honolulu Star-Bulletin</a>, delegates reasserted their commitment to build upon the Bali Road Map which calls for a post-Kyoto treaty to be hashed out by the end of 2009.

If anything was accomplished, it was limited to "building good will" between the US and its adversaries who want more action on reducing emissions.  While the <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-02/01/content_7545625.htm">French delegation expressed frustration</a> that the US was "lagging behind," others were more sanguine.  <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/detailgeneral.asp?fileid=20080201142105&irec=1">British environment minister Phil Woolas noted</a> increasing flexibility on the part of the US.

It seems increasingly unlikely that the Bush Administration will radically change its position against mandatory emissions restrictions, thus EU countries and <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jan2008/gb20080131_269036.htm?chan=globalbiz_europe+index+page_top+stories">other international figures will patiently await the results of the US election </a>next November.  Both Democratic candidates and the leading Republican candidate have expressed support for cap-and-trade systems for emissions reductions.  Bush will doubtlessly continue these meetings of the major economies and ministers will certainly turn up, but <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=02&year=2008&base_name=hype_not_hope">substantive agreements will likely be lacking</a>.]]></content:encoded>

Currently large-scale emissions of these substances--which are often the product of animal waste generated in industrial feed lots--must be reported so local municipalities and citizens know of the existence of hazardous substances.  The Post article posits this as another example of the Bush Administration favoring large corporations by making environmental regulations more lenient.  In this case, however, communities will not have the hard data needed to guage the extent of risk inherent in these industries.

The regulation changes are not a done deal.  <a href="http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-AIR/2007/December/Day-28/a25231.htm">According to the Federal Register</a>, the public comment period lasts until the end of next month.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>British Columbia Proposes Provincial Carbon Tax</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[British Columbia's Finance Minister Carole Taylor <a href="http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=ecea1487-507c-43ef-ab88-5a972898e0b7&k=38130">presented a proposal for a provincial tax</a> on carbon last week.  This marks the first attempt at such a scheme in North America.

The policy is designed to be revenue-neutral, whereby the new tax on carbon will be offset with decreases in income, corporate, and small business taxes.  Additionally, people with a low enough income will be given carbon tax credits and each BS resident will get a one-time $100 "climate change dividend" paymen.

If passed British Columbians can expect to pay an extra 2.5 centers per litre of gasoline beginning July 1, 2008.  All of the major gaseous, solid and liquid fuels will see tax increases rising incrementally from a base rate of $10 per tonne of CO2 emissions beginning later this year and rising $5 each subsequent year until 2012 when a tonne of emissions will cost $30.

This is a pretty bold move on the part of B.C.  But it is unlikely to be imitated anywhere in North America anytime soon.  <a href="http://www.upi.com/International_Security/Energy/Briefing/2008/02/25/ontario_rejects_carbon_taxes/7446/">Earlier today, Ontario Premier, Dalton McGuinty, rejected</a> the concept for his province while the federal Environment Minister, <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080220/carbon_tax_080220/20080220?hub=QPeriod">John Baird has also nixed the idea</a>.

The plan itself can be <a href="http://www.sbr.gov.bc.ca/documents_library/notices/British_Columbia_Carbon_Tax.pdf">downloaded in .pdf form from the provincial website</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Alaskan Village Sues Oil Companies</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Alaskan village of Kivalina is suing some of the country's largest oil and energy countries for damages incurred due to climate change.

Kivalina is located on a barrier island in northwestern Alaska on the  Chukchi Sea.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/us/27alaska.html?ex=1361768400&en=df9dbd2d5aa2d2b0&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">According to the New York Times</a>, the village has experienced flooding and an eroding coastline for a number of years and the inhabitants and all structures are being forced to relocate.

<img alt="Kivalina" title="Kivalina" src="http://www.nana.com/ndcenews/editionimages2/kivalinafull.jpg" />

Because of the association between anthropogenic climate change and rising sea levels, the village has decided to sue large energy companies like Exxon Mobil and Conoco Phillips for complicity in facilitating global warming which has caused them damages.

The suit has just been filed, but if Kivalina wins it could be historic--a monetary liability for human-induced global warming would be identified.  The suit is being filed for $400 million in damages for relocation of the village (although a 2006 relocation <a href="http://www.poa.usace.army.mil/en/cw/Kivalina/Kivalina.html">study by the Army Corps of Engineers</a> placed the relocation costs at around $250 million).

Stefan Milkowski, reporter for the <a href="http://newsminer.com/">Fairbanks Daily News-Miner</a> <a href="http://northernflux.blogspot.com/">maintains an interesting blog </a>on climate change in Alaska and the challenges facing circumpolar communities like Kivalina.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Suburban Slums?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Christopher Leinberger from the Brookings Institution has an <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200803/subprime">article posted on the Atlantic Monthly</a> website predicting the slumming of the suburb.  The latest wave of foreclosures that have been symptomatic of the mortgage crisis, Lienberger argues, are creating problems with crime, squatting, and other anti-social behavior in relatively calm suburban areas.

Rather than chalking up the problem simply to the vicissitudes of the housing bubble, Leinberger argues that suburbs are unlikely to bounce back.  Cities and urbanized, inner-ring suburbs have been desirable for the past decade or so and Leinberger does not see a reason to think that the trend will reverse.

Given the rise in energy prices and commute times, it seems like Leinberger is sound.  Of course one obstacle facing urban resurgence is the inadequate upkeep on key elements of the infrastructure--particularly in the realm of transportation.  Suburbs face transportation maintenance issues as well, but aging systems in urban areas--whose attractiveness is often associated with multiple options for mobility--are in a poor position to adapt to newfound growth without adequate public financing.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wal Mart&#039;s Sustainability Director Questions Company&#039;s Food Offerings</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=153</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Apparently Wal Mart runs a <a href="http://www.checkoutblog.com/">blog</a> and one of its contributors is Rand Wadoops,  a director at the company focused on sustainability issues.   He had a <a href="http://www.checkoutblog.com/entries/2008/2/26/yogurt___good_or_bad.aspx">post</a> earlier in the week noting that he had just finished reading <a href="http://www.michaelpollan.com/index.htm">Michael Pollan's</a> <em>Omnivore's Dilemma</em>.

One of Pollan's main points is that industrial food production and consumption is problematic from a health, environmental, and social standpoint.  Wadoops asks--in conjunction with this reading of Pollan--what can be done to "make the industrialized food chain better" and what sorts of products should Wal Mart stock (or not stock) in the name of sustainability?

The comments section of the blog offer interesting suggestions.  <a href="http://www.eatingliberally.org/story__let_s_ask_marion_what_can_wal_mart_do_to_promote_sustainability_feb_28_2008_id849">But I think Marion Nestle from NYU has an interesting (but undeveloped) answer</a>.  She suggests that they focus on processes of production rather than specific products.   I take this to mean that the company can develop a set of sustainability standards and then hold its producers to a set of rigorous standards.

Another point, which I didn't see addressed by Waloops' commentators is whether an "industrialized" food system is even compatible with sustainability.  Is it even structurally possible for a large-scale multinational food provider to develop a decentralized system of purchasing and distribution?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/01/opinion/01hedin.html?ex=1362114000&en=3d2c87b956499ea3&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">New York Times published an op-ed piece</a> today by Minnesota farmer, Jack Hedin recounting the difficulties he has encountered while producing fruit and vegetable crops for local consumption.

Apparently Hedin leased some land from farmers who had previously grown subsidized commodity crops (e.g. corn, soybeans, wheat).  When the Farm Services Administration found out that Hedin was growing organic fruit and vegetables on the land, they fined the land's owners for being out of compliance with the USDA commodity program.

<a href="http://tammybaldwin.house.gov/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=1370">Apparently the most recent (2002) farm bill does not require</a> that subsidized actually grow the commodity crops to receive the subsidy.  However, it does prohibit farmers from growing fruits and vegetables on their land.  So essentially, if you are a farmer who had been producing a commodity crop it is basically impossible for you to shift production to fruits and vegetables!

Last year a bipartisan effort led by Tammy Baldwin (WI) in the House and Richard Lugar (IN) and Dick Durbin (IL) in the Senate to reform this provision failed.

Currently, the House and Senate are developing the final farm bill that will be sent to the President.  It does not appear that the fruit and vegetable exemption is going to be overturned--although the issue of giving commodity subsidies to farmers that are letting their land lie fallow seems to be a bargaining chip.

The <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/28/MNMOV5QB7.DTL&type=politics">San Francisco Chronicle </a>has a good article on the current status of negotiations.  Notable in this presidential primary season, John McCain, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to vote on a bill that would have abolished commodity subsidies.

Also of interest on the issue of the planting restriction on fruits and vegetables is an <a href="http://freshtalk.blogspot.com/2007/07/on-planting-restriction.html">old blog post</a> by agriculture journalist Tom Karst.  He discusses how the issue has been a part of trade disputes in the WTO.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=522342">report from the Harvard Crimson</a> on a conference held earlier this week on <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/rappaport/events/greencities.htm">"Green Cities: Lessons from Boston and Beyond"</a> prompted me to look at the <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/climate/default.asp">city's recently completed climate action plan</a>.  Here in Chicago, the suburb immediately to the north--<a href="http://www.cityofevanston.org/global/green/warming.shtml">Evanston--is currently in the process of developing its own plan</a> for minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, so looking at Boston's efforts might be useful.

Buildings tend to be major sources of greenhouse gases.  In Boston, the city amended the code for large buildings (over 50,000 sq. ft.) to require that new projects be "LEED certifiable."  While the various levels of LEED certification can result in more energy efficiency, the standard for simply being "certifiable" is relatively weak.  Developers merely have to claim that they could get certified, without actually going through the process of verification.  <a href="http://www.edcmag.com/Articles/Blog/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000268931">As such, some critics contend</a> that this designation provides little confidence that buildings will actually be greener.

In the area of energy, the city has developed some modest examples of the utilization of renewables by employing  a photovoltaic  solar system in  a city-owned nature center and is studying the feasibility of a wind project in Boston Harbor.

Interestingly, Boston's plan does not offer real projections for emissions reductions nor are there calculations for how much GHGs have been reduced as a result of changes in policy.  In the executive order that pre-dated the plan, signed by the Mayor in April 2007, there were some targets listed.  Namely, the city "shall strive to meet or exceed the goal" of reducing annual emissions 7% below 1990 levels by 2012 and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.  These targets are consistent with the US Mayor's Climate Protection Agreement.  However, there is little in the plan to suggest how the precise targets will be met.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Both metropolitan Vancouver and Montreal are facing challenges storing and processing solid waste and are considering joining Ontario in exporting their garbage to the United States.  The <a href="http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=990c3877-0661-4261-8f61-a187c44086ed&k=16338&p=1">Lachenaie landfill in the suburbs of Montreal</a> is going to reach its capacity in August while <a href="http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=c7a4f7ee-5ac6-481a-9ef0-e51ae6f50091">continued dumping at British Columbia's Burns Bog Delta</a> landfill is <a href="http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=5f04ed9e-8dbc-49f6-80c2-d690b1f7fed1">being resisted by local residents</a>.

A weak US dollar, strong NIMBYism in Canada, and excess capacity in US landfills is making the export of Canadian trash an attractive option for these municipalities.  It will be interesting to see if politicians in the Washington and the US states that border Quebec resist the notion.  In Michigan <a href="http://stabenow.senate.gov/stoptrash/faq.htm">efforts to resist importation of Canadian trash</a> have been largely unsuccessful, in part due to NAFTA free trade protections.

Toronto, however, has been more proactive in reducing its waste stream.  <a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/301628">A proposal that is set to be implemented later this year</a> will give Toronto residents a choice of various size rubbish bins, with yearly collection fees tied to the size of the bins.  Users who choose the smallest bin will actually get a $10/year credit, while people who want larger bins will have to pay up to $190/year for the privilege of polluting.  While it could be argued that these fees are a bit regressive, given the fact that most solid waste can be recycled or composted, the fees could have the effect of changing consumer behavior and giving an incentive for less individual waste production.

		<title>Japan&#039;s Environment Minister Announces Cap-and-Trade Plan</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is still in its preliminary stages, <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/11/business/emit.php">but Japan's environment minister, Ichiro Kamoshita, announced today that the country may develop a cap and trade scheme to minimize its carbon emissions</a>.  Japan is a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol, but have relied largely on voluntary pledges from industry to meet their obligation of a 6% decrease from 1990 levels by 2012.

The fact that Japan is on the road to embracing a mandatory emissions scheme suggests that the US will be more isolated in its resistance to new mandatory caps that will likely be a part of a post-Kyoto agreement.  This also increases pressure on the United States since Japan is the host country for a series of G-8 meetings this year and they could potentially ally with European leaders in more forceful efforts to the the US to change its position.

This weekend marks the <a href="http://www.env.go.jp/earth/g8/en/g20/index.html">second meeting</a> this year where the major economies will discuss climate change strategies.  Nothing too substantive is expected to come out of these meetings, to be held in Chiba, Japan.  However, with this announcement from Kamoshita and the revelation that <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iVcSZS7q6cNL2cFffNMpw4MJVoBA">Tony Blair is expected to attend the proceedings</a>, it will be useful to watch closely for signs that the US may be loosening its resistance to the idea of mandatory emissions.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bush Opts for Weak Limits on Ozone</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Later this afternoon the US Environmental Protection Agency is supposed to announce new limits on ozone emissions.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/12/AR2008031202362.html?hpid=topnews">According to the Washington Post</a>, the administration will push the allowable limit from 80 parts of smog-forming ozone per billion to 75 parts per billion.

While this represents an improvement, it is not as strict as the levels advocated for by public health groups--nor as strict as limits argued for by the <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/AB290E0DB8B72A33852572120055858F/$File/casac-07-001.pdf">agency's own advisory committee of independent scientists [.pdf]</a>.

The EPA committee wanted a limit between 60 and 70 parts per million while the <a href="http://www.cleanairstandards.org/article/2008/03/756">American Lung Association is arguing for</a> the 60 parts per million figure.  In choosing to adopt the higher allowance of 75 parts per million, the Bush Administration is risking thousands of more premature deaths and cases of respiratory ailments.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As mentioned on Wednesday, the US EPA was facing a deadline this week mandated by law to update the regulations governing ozone emissions.  The agency is charged with evaluating current regulations every few years to make sure that they are reflective of scientific consensus regarding the risks involved with exposure to harmful pollutants.

EPA's board of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/13/washington/13enviro.html?ref=us">independent scientists recommended</a> that the standards for ozone particulates be strengthened from the current level of 84 parts per billion to no more than 70 parts per billion.  Environmentalists and public health advocates were pushing for a level of no more than 60 parts per billion.  The standards released on Wednesday were more modest at 75 parts per billion.

<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-ozone13mar13,1,6260697.story">The Los Angeles Times reported today that Bush himself</a> intervened to make sure that EPA Administrator  Stephen Johnson did not follow the scientific consensus and establish a more stringent standard.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/13/AR2008031304175.html?hpid=topnews">According to the Washington Post</a>, there is a suggestion that the EPA's legal obligations of protecting public welfare have been compromised and that the direct intervention of the White House in pushing for a specific regulation is a violation of the legal framework governing regulatory decision making, although other <a href="http://volokh.com/posts/1205502166.shtml">legal experts see nothing out of the ordinary</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Challenges of a Patchwork Climate Change Policy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/us/20energy.html?ex=1363665600&en=51c61a822ad9c932&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">New York Times has an interesting article today</a> on the various battles going on in US states related to the patchwork of climate change policies developed in recent years throughout the country.

In the absence of a national policy, states have taken the lead in mandating limits on greenhouse gas emissions and requiring power companies to increase the percentage of power generation coming from renewable resources.

The varied political reactions are interesting and speak to one issue that is not often highlighted in US energy policy debates: the geographic divergence of energy sources throughout the country.  A map accompanying the article shows how the central part of the country is dependent upon coal while the coasts utilize nuclear, hydroelectric (in the Pacific Northwest), and natural gas.

Given the fact that these various forms of electricity generation have differing levels of GHG emissions, it is not surprising to learn that the political battles are often more contentious in states with high percentages of coal use.

The article recounts how coal companies in Kansas are laying on a heavy public relations campaign to resist regulations on the construction of new coal-fired power plants, <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/11/greenwash_watch_3.php">going to great lengths to suggest that a failure to approve new plants is tantamount to supporting Hugo Chavez and Mahmood Ahmadinejad</a>.

The article mentions an interesting <a href="http://www.desmogblog.com">blog, DeSmogBlog</a>, which is dedicated to exposing some of the questionable tactics and industry ties of climate change "skeptics."

Not mentioned in the article is the fact that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, <a href="http://cjonline.com/stories/110707/sta_215603726.shtml">John McCain, has been using the big coal companies' advertisement as a prop in campaign stops.</a>  This is significant given McCain's apparent support for a mandatory cap-and-trade GHG emissions policy.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Amy Goodman's <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2008/3/21/censoring_science_inside_the_political_attack">Democracy Now had an insightful interview</a> this morning with <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/">James Hansen</a>, the Director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and one of the most prominent climate scientists in the United States.

Hansen has been subject to censorship by NASA political appointees who are unwilling to accept the science behind anthropocentric climate change.

He was joined in his appearance on Democracy Now by author, <a href="http://www.tipping-points.com/">Mark Bowen</a>, who <a href="http://mark-bowen.com/book_cs.html">has a new book out</a> about Hansen's travails with Bush Administration officials responsible for environmental policy who largely come from oil and coal industry backgrounds.

I have not read the book (<em>Censoring Science</em>), but it appears to have some interesting revelations, most notably that Dick Cheney's office has taken an active role in suppressing reports of scientific evidence related to climate change. It sounds like it should be an important documentation of the general politicization of science that has affected many areas of environmental policy under the Bush Administration.]]></content:encoded>

South Korea is the 13th largest economy in the world and the 9th largest emitter of GHGs.  While a detailed plan for reductions was not released, it appears that the South Koreans are relying heavily on encouraging gains in energy efficiency and not engaging in heavy regulation or caps on emissions.

It will interesting to see how Korea's actions figure into post-Kyoto climate change negotiations as they progress over the next several months since developing country reductions are a sticking point with the current US administration.  <a href="http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/003200803211724.htm">An AP report</a> on an initiative proposed by the new Korean president, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1663317_1663319_1669884,00.html">Lee Myung Bak</a>, to engage in a re-forestation partnership with North Korea suggested that the partnership could be a precursor to the South getting carbon offset credits under a post-Kyoto agreement.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://media3.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2008/03/23/GR2008032300097.gif" />It's a typical story for the Bush Administration in its approach to environmental policy: ignore an agency's own scientific conclusions, block the publication of agency reports recommending regulatory action, limit the amount of public input by environmentalists into decision making processes, fail to properly enforce long-standing laws.

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/03/23/ST2008032300179.html?sid=ST2008032300179">The Washington Post reports</a> on the latest chapter of the Bush environmental legacy as it relates to the Endangered Species Act.  According to their analysis, the number of threatened species being listed for protection has diminished to a trickle over the course of the Bush Administration.  This trend has occurred not as a result of improvements to threatened habitats, but rather due to willful inaction.  Now the Department of Interior is facing expensive lawsuits from concerned citizens seeking that the law actually be enforced.  Defending irresponsible management seems to be a pretty poor use of taxpayer resources.

		<title>Al Gore Launches Climate Change PR Campaign</title>

The article implies that the campaign is being launched during the election season to encourage US Presidential candidates to address the issue as central parts of their campaigns.  The article quotes presumptive Republican nominee John McCain as trying to distinguish himself from Democratic front-runner Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on the issue, pointing out that he has worked on the issue since before Obama or Clinton were elected to the Senate.  Of course the article also mentions that Obama's target of an 80 percent reduction of greenhouse gases from 1990 levels by 2050 surpasses McCain's more modest 60 percent reduction.

It will be interesting to see what effect Gore's campaign has on the general election campaign--particularly since climate change policy will be one of the few issues on which Obama and McCain share relatively similar views (at least, when put in contrast with Bush).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UK Cut Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 2% in 2007 (maybe)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/mar/28/fossilfuels.carbonemissions">UK Environment Minister Hilary Benn reported late last week</a> that the UK's greenhouse gas emissions dropped 2% to keep the country on track with its Kyoto commitment.  There is some dispute, however, as to  whether government policy should be credited for the reduction or the fact that energy producers shifted to natural gas from coal due to rising coal prices.  <a href="http://www.aib.subdivisions.co.uk/?p=747">There are also suggestions</a> that the way in which the figures are calculated miss many sources of emissions.

The independent National Audit Office has recently released a <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0708_greenhouse_gas_emissions.pdf">report [.pdf]</a> suggesting that the country's emissions are actually 12% higher than official government estimates presented to the UN.  Those figures do not account for emissions generated by aviation and shipping. <a href="http://www.talkclimatechange.com/2008/03/18/is-sir-humphrey-appleby-in-charge-of-climate-change-policy/">Whether or not you expect government shenanigans are involved</a> in which number Labour ministers choose to report, the NAO study is an important testament to the need for clear methods of calculating emissions and carbon footprints.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Toronto&#039;s Suburbs Seeing Bulk of New Immigrants</title>

In a reversal of trends in the immediate post-War era, new immigrants are heading to the suburbs rather than to central Toronto.

While Canada has a vastly different set of challenges related to immigration than the US, two of the explanations for the reversal struck me as interesting within the context of Chicago's metropolitan development.  The report cited both gentrification in central Toronto as well as the proliferation of low-barrier employment opportunities in the suburbs as possible reasons for the shift.  Higher housing costs in Toronto's trendy downtown neighborhoods and the lack of entry-level jobs make suburbs the "logical" choice for new immigrants to Toronto.

I would suspect that similar patterns might be evident in Chicago--although the vast size of the city provides more housing options inside Chicago's boundaries.  However, the bulk of the region's service sector jobs are situated in the suburban regions and we are seeing many suburban communities ill-equipped to accomodate new residents from the standpoint of social service provisions.

A choice quotation:
<blockquote>"A three-block section of [Chicago neighborhood] Wicker Park that once accommodated eight families, two vintage clothing stores, a French cleaners, and a gourmet bakery has been completely razed to make way for a private livery stable and carriage house," Kennedy said. "The space is now entirely unusable for affordable upper-income condominium housing. No one can live there except for the odd stable boy or footman who gets permission to sleep in the hayloft."</blockquote>

Many independent companies have popped up to provide guilt-ridden western consumers the ability to offset the carbon produced by their automobiles, plane trips, etc... by financing afforestation programs.  The problem, of course, is that it does little to decrease actual emissions in the short term while offering people a false sense of security that problems associated with climate change can be easily addressed. ]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Bartling/UntitledAlbum/photo#5187646858669706290"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/Bartling/R_45VSctzDI/AAAAAAAAAY4/_qmKIZ0tH6U/s400/Snapshot%202008-04-10%2010-57-02.jpg" /></a>

The table above--gleaned from the report--shows the projected rise in prices of basic grains over the next several years.   While there is variation in the projections, the report indicates that higher fertilizer prices (which are petroleum-based) and the conversion of land to produce biofuels are main factors in the global market's inability to meet demand.  This report should provide another note of caution to those folks who argue that biofuels can seamlessly replace fossil fuels at current rates of consumption.

		<title>Bush Vows to Increase Greenhouse Gas Emissions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[US President George W. Bush gave <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/04/20080416-6.html">a speech on Wednesday</a> laying out his position on climate change in advance of the third  "major economies" meeting on the issue in taking place today in Paris.

The speeh was underwhelming and no significant proposals were announced.  The main highlight was a stated "goal" (not a mandate) to wait until 2025 to stop the growth in greenhouse gas emissions.  The strategy for achieving this goal is limited to a series of incentives that are "carbon-weighted to make lower emissions power sources less expensive relative to higher emissions sources."  No specific proposal was given that might describe such an incentive structure, although Bush did mention a need to reduce the regulatory barriers facing the development of nucelar power plants.

Essentially the speech will likely further isolate the US from the international community and reinforce notions that the administration is not really serious about addressing climate change.

While the signatories to Kyoto are <em>reducing</em> their emissions from 1990 levels by 2012, Bush is delaring that the US should not even begin emissions reductions until 2025.  The top White House official responsible for climate change policy, former utilities lobbyist Jim Connaughton, stated the effects quite clearly in his press conference preceding Bush's speech:  "our goal is to have the economy rise and have greenhouse gases rise."

The response to Bush's speech was predicatbly critical.  The German Environment Minister <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=143&art_id=nw20080417150439759C431049">Sigmar Gabriel described</a> Bush as exhibiting <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/17/a-german-creatively-pans-bushs-climate-speech/?hp">"losership"</a> rather than leadership and described his speech as "neanderthal."  <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120845683885323553.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">The Wall Street Journal reports</a> that many <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/environmentalcapital/2008/04/17/the-french-disconnection-bush-plan-fizzles-at-paris-climate-talks/?mod=WSJBlog">developing nations taking part in the Paris conference</a> were also disappointed in Bush's speech.

In the US, the <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bal-ed.greenhouse18apr18001519,0,4347367.story">Baltimore Sun contends</a> that Bush "just doesn't get it" with regard to the problem of climate change and the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/18/EDOG107K2F.DTL">San Francisco Chronicle juxtaposes</a> Bush's hollow rhetoric with the action taken by fellow Republican Governor Schwarzenegger on the issue.

Given the vociferous reaction to Bush's speech, it is probably wishful thinking to expect anything significant to come out of the Paris meetings.  While <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/climate/would-you-care-about-climate-change-more-if-you-lived-in-a-mud-hut">Archbishop Desmond Tutu offered a moral argument</a> for serious movement at the Paris talks,  UN climate change chief, Yvo de Boer was more diplomatic saying that it was "good" the US has a proposal on the table.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Major Economies Meeting Ends With No Agreement</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The latest in the US-sponsored meeting of "major economies" to discuss ways of addressing climate change <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hDQzyHvXPYzhJsBSImRWB7L1JhpAD904GM2O1">ended on Friday</a> with no major agreements.

US President Bush's Wednesday speech reasserting his reluctance to commit the US to any emission reductions cast a shadow on the proceedings.  With the US delegation not wanting to start emission reductions until 2025 and the EU wanting to reduce emissions by 20% from 1990 levels by the same year, the gulf between the two positions is as wide as the Atlantic Ocean.

One issue that often is obscured in discussions about the US-EU rift on the topic, is the real immediate need pushed by developing countries for adaptation funding.  The countries that are least financially equipped to deal with the effects of climate change are those that are feeling its most immediate consequences.  <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i5F-QlDqPpaTzK4YavRCOgrWCgtw">Both South Africa and Mexico tried to push the issue</a> of establishing financing mechanisms for climate adaptation.

These latter appeals may gain some traction as the major economies meetings continue until their culmination in the summer's G-8 summit in Japan.  I could see all of the major parties wanting to show some accomplishment on the issue by agreeing to boost adaptation funds (whether the money is ever allocated is another story).

In fact, we see gestures on this front, such as French President Nicholas Sarkozy's remarks at the meeting arguing for <a href="http://news.therecord.com/article/339011">more money to be spent on a low-carbon economy </a>and his linkage of the drought in <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/04/18/2221495.htm">Sudan, climate change, and violence in Darfur</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Tricky Relationship Between Parking and Transit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.thestar.com/article/416124">Toronto Star has an article </a>on a dilemma facing transit officials and transportation planners in the Greater Toronto Area.  At issue is the fact that parking facilities for commuters at many suburban stations do not meet demand, causing would-be transit riders to drive around looking for a parking space in vain and wind up driving to their destination.

On the one hand, the demand suggests that more people prefer commuting by transit; however, on the other hand, the situation illuminates the fact that the larger suburban landscape surrounding these transit stations is only accessible by automobile.

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Bartling/UntitledAlbum/photo#5192087890133568706"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/Bartling/SA4AbV4EzMI/AAAAAAAAAa4/lCAJ2B3zc-8/s400/Clarkson.jpg" /></a>

The above photo shows the Clarkson GO stop in suburban Mississauga.  Surrounded by a massive parking lot, there is no viable pedestrian or bike linkages to the station.  One of the main problems, as alluded to in the article, is the fact that GO doesn't charge for parking.  The transit agency could change the incentive structure and levy a fee for parking, but the surrounding landscape is configured in such a way as to make it extremely difficult to access.

The main way out of the dilemma is to transform land uses surrounding the station to more mixed-use, high density development.]]></content:encoded>

Among the points they point out are the facts that ethanol takes a significant amount of energy to produce, the ethanol production process has hazardous environmental byproducts, ethanol production is partially responsible for driving up food prices, and that these market pressures are resulting in deforestation.

They also caution us to believe claims about ethanol's viability to "decrease our dependence on foreign oil," suggesting that it does not have that capacity to satisfy our rising demand for fossil fuels.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.laddarboretum.org/images/trees/white%20oak_tree.jpg" />

In honor of <a href="http://www.arborday.org/arborday/index.cfm">Arbor Day</a>, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/24/AR2008042403952.html?hpid=topnews">Washington Post has an article</a> on the resurgence of municipal tree planting efforts.  In this age of "green consciousness" pledges to plant trees appear to be an easy way for local politicians to earn points with voters.

The article points out that it has not been uncommon in recent years for mayors of big cities like Los Angeles, New York, and Salt Lake City to promise planting of "a million new trees" in their respective cities.

What gets lost in the midst of arboreal enthusiasm is the fact that maintaining trees in urban settings is expensive.  Pollution, pavement, improper care are all issues that municipalities have to contend with as they engage in reforestation plans.  One of the interesting points brought up in the article is the geographic inequities apparent in existing urban forest cover.  Citing the experience of greater Los Angeles, the article points out that low income neighborhoods are more barren of trees than high income neighborhoods.

The fact that trees are an important element of attractive public spaces makes this "arboreal inequity" a concern.  Could equal access to municipal landscape infrastructure prompt a new rethinking of urban "environmental justice"?

The Post article reminded me of <a href="http://urbanresearchlab.com/evanston.aspx">research that I am currently undertaking on the 1917 Plan of Evanston</a>.  Part of the plan recommended that the city establish its own nursery and
engage in an aggressive public landscaping effort.  The recommendation was never implemented, but the relatively dense tree cover that is extant suggests that the city has had a longstanding interest in tree promotion.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Expanding Global Footprint of Food</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=177</link>
		<pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2008 17:03:22 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Hugh Bartling]]></dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=177</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As part of its <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/series/the_food_chain/index.html">continuing series</a> on the economics of food, the New York Times has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/26/business/worldbusiness/26food.html?ex=1366862400&en=435ef89fe4640d57&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">a good article today on the globalization of food</a> and the environmental impacts of the global food system.

The article discusses how market pressure and the search for low-cost sources for labor in the processing of agricultural commodities has driven much of the increase in "food miles" between producer and consumer.

What struck me as under-appreciated, however, is the fact that fuel for international shipping is exempt from taxation as a part of the <a href="http://www.icao.int/icaonet/dcs/7300.html">Convention on International Civil Aviation</a>.  The result, of course, is that fuel prices are artificially lower for international trade, providing an incentive for fuel-intensive exports.

The Convention was negotiated in 1944 when issues of climate change and environmentalism were not on the international policy agenda.  Not surprisingly, the shipping industry is not enthusiastic about closing this loophole.

The article points out, however, that both aviation and commercial shipping could be incorporated in the European Union's carbon trading scheme, requiring shippers to reduce their carbon emissions.  This would be a welcome advance and pave the way for more accurate pricing mechanisms to take into account the environmental stress accompanying the global shipments of food.

The other interesting point brought up in the article has to do with efforts on the part of industry to account for and provide information to consumers about the carbon footprint of food products.  The British grocery store giant, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/apr/16/carbonfootprints.tesco">Tesco is going to begin providing</a> a <a href="http://www.tesco.com/climatechange/carbonFootprint.asp">carbon accounting</a> on many of its house branded products beginning next month.

One of the problems associated with carbon labeling is getting an accurate measure for all of the carbon inputs for particular products.  Systems of production, transportation, refrigeration, and distribution are highly complex and are likely to involve scores of contractors, sub-contractors, and subsidiaries, making the effort to access accurate data difficult.

Given the decentralized nature of these current efforts, information can be provided by individual companies, such as Tesco, but it may be difficult for consumers to trust the accuracy of carbon labels.  More effective would be an international convention on carbon accounting--although I haven't heard of any serious efforts to develop such an agreement.

Finally, the article provides some interesting fodder for rethinking our conceptions about local, national vs. global food as it pertains to carbon footprints.  They offer a graphic that compares the carbon impact of two hypothetical bottles of wine: one from France, and another from California.  When all of the carbon inputs are taken into account, the French bottle has a smaller carbon footprint--primarily due to the difference in modes of transport.

		<title>Bike Sharing in Washington, DC</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/27/us/27bikes.html?ex=1366948800&en=610361f466380241&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">According to the New York Times</a>, the first bike sharing program in the United States is scheduled to debut next month in the nation's capital.  While these systems are <a href="http://www.inhabitat.com/2007/07/22/bike-sharing-to-save-cities/">common</a> in <a href="http://www.ecobusinesslinks.com/city-bike-sharing.htm">Europe</a>, this is the first significant program sponsored by an American municipality.

The program is quite modest: 120 bicycles available at 10 docking stations all located within about a kilometer radius north of the White House.  The program is being financed by Clear Channel and will be supportive through advertisement sales and a $40.00 subscription fee.  Users borrow a bike and are expected to return it to a docking station within 3 hours.

While a representative for DC's transportation department contends that the program "will help us reduce congestion and pollution," that seems a bit ambitious given the small size of the program and the limited area that is served.  Only central DC is covered--an area that already has pretty efficient subway service.  It is not clear why someone would choose to use a bike as opposed to hop on the subway (or even walk) to get to their destination.

One area not covered is the National Mall and areas south of the White House--places that are teeming with tourists.  I would expect that this scheme might be more attractive to tourists wanting a nice, efficient way of getting from, say, the Lincoln Memorial to Capitol Hill.  Regardless, given the fact that the sharing program is only available to annual subscribers, the lack of a day-use option would inhibit tourist usage of the service.

It will be interesting to see how this program develops.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/apr/29/climatechange.carbonemissions">The Guardian has an article</a> on the variety of policy mechanisms used by Sweden to reduce the country's carbon footprint.

Of particular interest is the country's carbon tax--an idea that has gained <a href="http://www.carbontax.org/blogarchives/2008/04/24/near-unanimity-for-tax-at-tv-roundtable-on-carbon-pricing/">more visibility</a> in <a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/4/16/112741/007">the US</a> as a result of the advocacy of Al Gore and others.  According to the article, there is a $1.44 per gallon tax on petrol contributing to greenhouse gas emission reductions in excess of the country's obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.

There main beneficiary of the carbon tax has been the biomass industry that has been exempt from the taxation.

The prospects for carbon taxation in the US seem pretty slim--particularly <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/15367.html">when you see</a> <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/energy_and_environment_/2008/04/gas_prices.php">ill-conceived proposals</a> by presidential candidates <a href="http://time-blog.com/curious_capitalist/2008/04/john_mccains_gastax_pander.html">John McCain</a> and <a href="http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=7354">Hillary Clinton</a> to actually reduce the gas tax temporarily during the campaign season.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Chicago Gets $153 Million from Feds to Reduce Congestion</title>

<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/chi-chicago-traffic-congestion-web-apr30,0,543062.story">Chicago seems to be the beneficiary</a> of New York Mayor <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/04/bloomberg-congestion-fee-no-go.php">Michael Bloomberg's inability</a> to get the New York Assembly to go along with his London-style congestion charging scheme.

Today, <a href="http://www.dot.gov/affairs/dot6008.htm">US Transportation Secretary Mary Peters awarded</a> Chicago $153 million to use for congestion relief efforts.  Among the projects that will be implemented as a result of the influx in money are:  the development of four Bus Rapid Transit lanes on unidentified "major city corridors"; the development of variable pricing parking meters downtown; and implementation of traffic signal priority for buses.

What strikes me is the fact that these enhancements are quite modest and long-overdue.  As a point of comparison, $153 million is $100 million less than the Feds contributed to THE INSURANCE POLICY for the 3.5 mile Big Dig road project in Boston.

Additionally, this week my Sustainable Cities class is reading selections from <a href="http://www.arch.virginia.edu/faculty/TimothyBeatley/">Tim Beatley's</a> book, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wilCClAxO7cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=green+urbanism&client=firefox-a&sig=dq2MwojKrUt9VtYrfnilRXumMNw">Green Urbanism: Learning from European Cities</a>.  Each one of these measures have been implemented successfully in various European cities over a decade ago.

It will be interesting to see where the CTA and the city decide to implement the bus rapid transit and how they go about doing it.  About a year or so ago, there were some feasibility studies done for enhancing north-south connections between the elevated railway lines that extend out of downtown Chicago like spokes in a wheel.

If I recall correctly, the preferred route in that study was on Cicero Ave. going south from the Kennedy Expressway to 85th Street.  According to a <a href="http://www.cookdupagecorridor.com/PDF/System-ProjectRecs_APP.pdf">recent planning document [.pdf]</a>, the cost of a that system would be around $1.3 billion.  This, I believe, is to construct separate bus lanes, isolated from car traffic.  Obviously, the money promised today from the Feds wouldn't go very far in implementing the Cicero BRT.

More likely (and cheaply), the city could use existing right-hand lanes on four-lane roads for the exclusive use of buses, much like is done in Dublin.

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Bartling/UntitledAlbum/photo#5194746689638157554"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/Bartling/SBdyl14EzPI/AAAAAAAAAc4/JAZPCCSBOXg/s400/Dublinbus.gif" /></a>

UPDATE: A key point about the Federal money that is missing from all of the media coverage I've seen today is the fact that the allocation is dependent on the city privatizing its parking meter system--something that had been floated by Mayor Daley in recent weeks, but which will likely be scrutinized given his penchant for selling off many of the city's assets.

<a href="http://fastlane.dot.gov/secretarysblog/2008/04/great-news-for.html">The Mayor is a "guest blogger"</a> on USDOT Secretary Peters' new blog, <a href="http://fastlane.dot.gov/">Fast Lane</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Canadian Biofuel Subsidies Expose Fragile Governing Coalition</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Much like the US, the Canadian government invests billions of dollars each year to subsidize the production of biofuels, such as ethanol. <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080430.wethanol30/BNStory/National/?pageRequested=1">The Globe and Mail reports</a> that the current financing legislation working its way through the House of Commons is showing that many of the opposition parties are not clearly unified on biofuel policy.

Liberal leader, Stephane Dion, has argued for the expansion of ethanol targets in recent months.  The left-leaning NDP leader has also been a supporter of biofuels.  However, as recent global food price hikes are being linked to increases in biofuel production, many rank-and-file opposition party members appear to be questioning the wisdom of government subsidies to a heavily profitable industry that is exacerbating food insecurity.

While the financing legislation is expected to pass, MPs from the Bloc Québécois, the NDP and Liberals may break from party leaders.

As a contrast to US biofuel policy, the Canadian experience is interesting.  Much of the Canadian debate is centered on global poverty and the international impact of biofuels expansion.  In the US, the debate has been muted. <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/USA/US_mulls_an_addition_of_200_mn_in_emergency_food_aid/articleshow/2993441.cms">Senator Dick Dubin of Illinois has called for authorizing emergency food aid</a>, and even broached the link between food scarcity and ethanol subsidies yesterday.  However, <a href="http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/ethanol-part-of-food-crisis--says-durbin-2008-04-28.html">as a report in The Hill indicates</a>, Durbin was hesitant to reject current policies subsidizing corn-based ethanol production.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Hugh,
Thanks for the post but I wanted to let you know that there isn't a rift between the rank and file of NDP and leadership on the issue of biofuel. There is a general re-think given the current food crisis. The NDP never saw biofuel as the silver bullet but did consider it to be a part of a comprehensive plan to reduce GHG emissions including increased transit funding, a green car strategy, greening the manufacturing economy, incentives for retrofitting homes and businesses, etc. Jack Layton, the leader of the  party has been an active environmentalist for decades. If your Canadian readers are interested in finding out more about the NDP's enviro policies they should check out the NDP website - www.ndp.ca.
Cheers]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks, Jay, for giving some context relating to the NDP's position.  I realize I didn't do it justice in the post.  Jack Layton has certainly been out front on urban/environment issues in the past--particularly on issues of sustainability.

I wasn't too aware of the NDP position on ethanol until I saw this article.  It actually surprised me that Layton & the NDP had been ethanol supporters given its dubious promise as an an ecologically-friendly alternative to fossil fuels and the party's sophisticated understanding of environmental issues.]]></wp:comment_content>

One of the hallmarks of the Bush/Cheney method of governing in the US has been to systematically ignore and subvert the recommendations of government scientists on issues pertaining to envrionmental policy.  Much of this effort has been focused on climate science.

Apparently--<a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/04/cheneys_office_do_not_save_the.php">according to Talking Points Memo</a>--Cheney's office is expanding his scope into influencing shipping regulations designed to protect endangered <a href="http://www.acsonline.org/factpack/RightWhale.htm">right whales</a>.  Apparently, the Vice President's office is not convinced by NOAA scientists who find that ship speeds impact whale injury and wants to stop the National Marine Fisheries Service from issuing a  rule that will protect the whales.   It is not clear why Cheney's office is so interested in blocking the routine rulemaking activites of a relatively obscure government agency, but it is unlikely that enhancing environmental protection is the administration's prime motivating factor.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The politicization of environmental policy continues at the behest of the Bush Administration as the head of the Chicago regional EPA office was sacked for attempting to enforce environmental regulations.

According to an <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/green/chi-epa-official-resigns_webmay02,0,4655733.story">interview with the Chicago Tribune</a>, Mary Gade was forced to resign as EPA Region 5 administrator after she wouldn't relent in forcing Dow Chemical to clean up dioxin the company dumped in Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron.  As the article points out, the EPA's regional offices have a high degree of autonomy in the ways they pursue cases, so this type of involvement from Washington is unusual.

Brad Johnson at the <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/05/01/mary-gade-firing/">Center for American Progress likens Gade's</a> firing to the scandalous firings of US Attorneys at disgraced former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez's Justice Department.  David Dempsey, who worked with Gade as an advocate with the Michigan Environmental Council <a href="http://daviddempsey.typepad.com/davesblog/2008/05/shocked-but-not.html">was "shocked but not surprised"</a> by the firing.]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/may/02/greenbuilding.ethicalliving"> </a><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/may/02/greenbuilding.ethicalliving">Much like the Prince's earlier planned community, </a><a href="http://www.princes-foundation.org/index.php?id=176">Poundbury</a> in Dorchester, Sherford is designed as a high-density, traditional development.  Of interest is the effort put into making the town of 12,000 future residents "green." In addition to the requisite open space that characterizes neo-traditional developments, the Guardian article indicates that Sherford will also have an on-site wind turbine system for generating electricity and a goal of acquiring two-thirds of the construction materials for the town within a 50-mile radius.  Green roofs will also be prominent on many of the buildings.
I visited Poundbury a few years ago and found it very impressive.  Unlike many New Urbanist communities built in the US and Canada, which tend to be sited in exurban areas, Poundbury flows logically and seamlessly to the older town of Dorchester.  At <a href="http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=181429&command=displayContent&sourceNode=229968&home=yes&more_nodeId1=133174&contentPK=20397265">490 hectares</a>, Sherford is more than three times as large as Poundbury, so the size is significant.

The South Hams District Council has <a href="http://www.southhams.gov.uk/spec_planning_apps_detail-new.htm?SHORTID=9/2426/06/O">scores of planning documents related to Sherford on its website</a>.

		<title>Bush Administration (Sort of) Weighs in on Gas Tax Debate</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=186</link>
		<pubDate>Sat, 03 May 2008 00:05:16 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As John McCain and Hillary Clinton advocated this week for the insane proposition of a "gas tax holiday," President Bush has remained officially neutral.  Asked whether he supported a temporary reduction of the gas tax, he went only so far as to say <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/05/mccains-rhetori.html">"we'll consider interesting ideas." </a>

Today, however, Bush's Transportation Secretary, <a href="http://fastlane.dot.gov/secretarysblog/2008/05/a-gas-tax-holid.html">Mary Peters, proclaimed</a> that she "welcome[s] the debate, and think[s] it is a terrific opportunity to have a larger discussion about the gas tax."

On her blog, she used the debate to push her pet passion: congestion charging.  Saying that the current gas tax system is "increasingly outdated, inefficient, and unpopular," she argues for a system whereby the user pays the true price of the good.

From an environmental standpoint, this is a good thing.  Currently, the price Americans pay for the infrastructure of automobility <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/sprawl/articles/subsidies.asp">is not close to covering the true environmental costs</a>. Congestion schemes such as the ones instituted in London and Stockholm use revenues generated by the congestion charge to finance public transportation or to offset the environmental externalities associated with driving.

For Peters, however, the use of the congestion charge and road pricing are clearly not meant to provide incentives for the use of other mobility options.  Rather, the charge is basically used to allow self-financing of the road scheme and serve the larger neo-liberal purpose: a gradual dissolution of government support for public goods in favor of the market.

While she couches the advantages of road pricing in terms of "fairness" and "efficiency," it is important to ask <em>just where the revenues are going to be spent</em>.  If money from a congestion charge is not reinvested in more widely-accessible public goods (like transit), then such a scheme will merely price low-income people out of driving.  Without a reliable mobility alternative, the people who can least afford the cost will bear the brunt of a new tax and the environmental consequences associated with automobility will not be addressed.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>LA County&#039;s War Against Street Food</title>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/greattacohunt/"><em>(photo credit: Great Taco Hunt)</em></a>
The front page of today's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/03/us/03taco.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">New York Times features</a> an article about the recent strengthening of regulations on taco trucks in unincorporated Los Angeles County.  Proponents of taco trucks highlight how they contribute to a creative and vibrant use of public space, the availability of a cheap source of food, budding immigrant entrepreneurship, and an assertion of cultural identity. Critics charge that unregulated trucks have questionable sanitation, generate litter, and are unfair competition to mom-and-pop neighborhood restaurants.

While taco trucks have always been subject to regulations relating to the places where they can park and the duration they can stay in any one place, according to the article penalties have been mild and violators are rarely pursued.  The new ordinance criminalizes violators by requiring jail time and upping the fines for violations.

I am a great proponent of street food.  Here on the north side of Chicago, one of the signs of spring is the appearance of the La Monarcha <a href="http://www.timeout.com/chicago/articles/features/20708/licking-the-competition">paleteria</a> bike/carts and the mobile elote stands.  While the issues of litter shouldn't be discounted, these vendors generally contribute positively to the street culture, bringing out all sorts of people for a bit of nourishment.  Their presence will likely to continue to be under scrutiny--primarily, I think, because of more established businesses wanting to quell competition.  But regardless, this type of legislation passed in Los Angeles is unwise in its severity.

See the <a href="http://tacohunt.blogspot.com/">Great Taco Hunt blog</a> for more information on the LA street food scene and the controversy over the new taco truck legislation.

		<title>Hillary Clinton: Economists Be Damned!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Cynical voter pandering" is the only way to describe the McCain-Clinton proposals to hold a "gas tax holiday" this summer.  Suspending the tax will unlikely have a significant effect on price, it would reduce the amount of money for road maintenance in the already-troubled Highway Trust Fund, and (if the tax cut did spur consumption) have negative environmental consequences.

Clinton's promotion of such a questionable scheme can lilkely be chalked up to desperate self-interest to shore up her increasingly-dim prospects for the Democratic presidential nomination.  However, her response to a query on <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/story?id=4783456&page=1">this morning's <em>This Week With George Stephanopoulos</em></a> raises even more questions about her capacity for governance.

When asked by Stephanopoulous to name an economist who supports her scheme, she replied that "I'm not going to put in my lot with economists because I know if we get it right, if we actually did it right, if we had a president who used all the tools of the presidency, we would design it in such a way that it would be implemented effectively."

As <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/election_2008_/2008/05/expertise_and_elitism.php">Mark Kleimen describes</a> her rejection of expert knowledge, the response is positively Bush-like.  Making claims for policy based on delusion  and wishful thinking are unlikely to serve Clinton well after eight years of the same model of governing.

Bill Clinton's former Labor Secretary, <a href="http://robertreich.blogspot.com/2008/05/hillary-clinton-doesnt-listen-to.html">Robert Reich, makes a similar argument</a>.  He also apparently called economists he knows who are advising Hillary for comment--none gave very satisfactory answers.]]></content:encoded>

Perhaps as a recognition of <a href="http://www.compostawarenessweek.org.uk/">Compost Awareness Week</a>, the New York Times has three articles today dealing with the issue of urban garbage.

The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/us/07garbage.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">first is a success story</a> of the various policies underway in San Francisco to encourage recycling.  The article asserts that 70% of the city's waste stream is diverted from landfills and recycled or composted. This figure is pretty remarkable, especially considering recycling is not mandatory.  The norm in the United States seems to be the reverse, with around 30% of the waste stream being recycled.

The city has been successful at selling its waste to Chinese companies that use some of it for packaging (no discussion of the carbon footprint involved in this process!)  They also appear to have a policy that charges more for the larger amount of waste produced for each home.  According to Mayor Gavin Newsome, the city is considering a target of 75% waste diverted from landfills by making recycling mandatory.

The other two garbage-related stories today are not so positive.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/world/europe/07italy.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">The Times reports</a> on yesterday's lawsuit filed by the European Commission to make Italy clean up the garbage in Naples.  <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL0830577220080109">Apparently the mafia controls</a> the waste distribution system.  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22573281/">Legitimate dumps are filled to capacity </a>and are improperly used for dumping hazardous waste.  To compensate for the capacity issues, it appears the mafia either doesn't pick up the garbage or dumps it illegally in the countryside.

It will be interesting to see how the EU lawsuit unfolds since <a href="http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Security/?id=1.0.2136493287">the European Court of Justice could levy serious</a> fines if Italy doesn't come up with a solution to the problem.  It may not come to this since new Prime Minister <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gXQv8MgdVWEOKeUsWyQm0Gcv-xcAD9029EGG0">Silvio Berlusconi made the Naples cleanup</a> a central part of last month's election campaign.  Berlusconi, however, is a bit of a euroskeptic, so he may not take kindly to EU sanctions.

Finally, to complete the urban garbage hat trick, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/world/asia/07crows.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">the Times has a story</a> on efforts to combat crows in Japan.  Apparently crows feasting on urban Japan's copious supply of garbage are becoming aggressive.  According to the article, efforts to control crow populations are conflicting with a conservation ethic predominant in Japan.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Keith Johnson at the Wall Street Journal's excellent Environmental Capital blog gives a <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/environmentalcapital/2008/05/09/clean-coal-black-gold-or-fools-gold/">great rundown today</a> on debates brewing over "clean coal."

Industrialized countries like the US and Australia (as well as "developing" econmies like India) have extensive domestic supplies.  However, coal is not only the dominant fuel for generating electricity in these economies, but it is also a major source fo greenhouse gases.

The push for clean coal--much like the push for biofuels--is regarded by many environmentalists as a quixotic attempt to find a technological fix out of a serious global problem.

Others are more pragmatic, feeling that if it is possible to capture the carbon when it is burned and inject it into the earth or sequestering it another way, it could be a viable way for minimizing global carbon emissions.

The problem, of course, is that the technologies for clean coal are still imperfect; but also coal fired power plants are continuing to be <a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200805081709DOWJONESDJONLINE001114_FORTUNE5.htm">built in the US</a> and <a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2008/05/10/stories/2008051051600200.htm">throughout</a> the <a href="http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ilo/2008/05/10/news/immediate.remedy.for.city.power.problem.needed.html">developing</a> <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssEnergyNews/idUSL0946840020080509">world</a> without regard to the effects of GHG emissions.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>High Gas Prices = Higher Levels of Transit Usage</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=191</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/10/business/10transit.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">New York Times reported</a> on one of the perceived consequences of the incresase in petrol prices in the US: ridership increases on the country's public transportation systems.

The increases are most dramatic in Sunbelt cities where lower density development and bus-dominated systems are the norm.  While the article doesn't offer a statistical analysis to isolate high gas prices as the key variable in explaining ridership increases, the fact that these increases are occurring during a period of stagnant economic growth is telling.

Normally ridership figures mimic boom and bust economic cycles; but this has not been the case this year.

Although transit agencies are undoubtedly glad to see more people using their services, they are still experiencing strain as they are also affected by high energy prices and (in many places) dilapidated fleets.

Nevertheless, more exposure to public transportation could result in a greater appreciation of it as an essential public good.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>More Details Emerge about Chicago&#039;s Bus Rapid Transit Scheme</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=192</link>
		<pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2008 17:03:53 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Bartling/UntitledAlbum/photo#5199165314371028834"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/Bartling/SCclTpueB2I/AAAAAAAAAgA/Xbu67E5yOh8/s400/2449462_0030f01f05_b.jpg" /></a>

As I mentioned last week, Chicago has been promised $133 million to improve bus service in the city.  Money will go to develop bus-only lanes, bus traffic signal priority, and to purchase hybrid fuel buses.

On Friday, t<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-cta-bus-lanes_10may11,0,7274662.story">he CTA announced</a> that the first four routes to be enhanced will be the 79th Street, Jeffery Express, Halstead, and Chicago Ave. lines.  It is still unclear just where on these lines bus only lanes will be transfigured.  However, the article in the Tribune suggests that the lanes may only give buses priority during the rush hours.

Other, more promising developments, discussed in the scheme appear to be developing better bus stops at 1/2 mile intervals and with real-time arrival information provided electronically--similar to the London system pictured above.

The scheme appears to be integrating many of the best practices found in other cities where rapid bus service has been developed successfully.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I Just relocated to my SWEET open-space apartment overlooking the ocean. Instead of going to WalMart and beginning to lugl and (even worse) begin to put together one of these things, I found my <a href="http://www.milesgershon.com" rel="nofollow"><b>Entertainment Center</b></a> on MilesGershon.Com, these guys sent me pictures of my unit in all different angles, (which for me was important, because I wanted to know how the inside of the <a href="http://www.milesgershon.com/wall-unit.html/" rel="nofollow"><b>Wall Unit</b></a> would look like. Anyways: I make the order and (finally) as promised 10 days later, my unit arrives, the guys put it together, and then ask me to sign off on the installation, then they take out the boxes and made sure the area was clean. I thought customer service was dead in the age of the internet. Hats off to these guys. I urge you all to put out a recommendation on folks that actually provide some level of good service these days. I'm happy to write a POSITIVE review for a change!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Bartling/UntitledAlbum/photo#5199519893986084722"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/Bartling/SChny5ueB3I/AAAAAAAAAgk/dibcw3gDdtQ/s400/110304058_f49648bb2b.jpg" /></a>
Yesterday's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/realestate/11wczo.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">New York Times had an article</a> about discussions going on in suburban Westchester County (NY) to look at office parks as potential sites for residential development.

Office parks are a peculiar product of post-War suburban zoning logic whereby suburbs segregated land uses contributing to low-density, sprawling development.  People live in residential districts, work in office parks, and shop in commercial districts.  The land use functions are separated, but linked by four lane arterial roads.  The decentralized nature of the development makes transit uneconomical and zoning laws, in turn, require that developers provide copious fields of parking spaces.

As people have come to recognize the problematic aspects of this logic (congestion, carbon-intensive energy use, too much time spent in cars), new approaches towards reconfiguring the suburban landscape are emerging.

Thus, this article in the New York Times shows how office parks could be targets for redevelopment, with a focus on mixed-use residential.  Office parks already have basic infrastructure in place and normally have a surplus of underutilized land.  While green space exists, it is normally ornamental.  Traditional zoning requirements prompted developers to build excessive amounts of parking.

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Bartling/UntitledAlbum/photo#5199526589840099202"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/Bartling/SCht4pueB4I/AAAAAAAAAgw/x5xFM1_sGxI/s400/210609027068.png" /></a>

While it makes sense to encourage mixed-use development in these spaces, as the article attests, there will undoubtedly be political resistance to these schemes.  In the case of Westchester, several office park sites are being identified as places to build affordable housing--something that engenders hostility on the part of many suburban governments.

Market forces and the environmental/quality of life problems associated with sprawling suburbia, however, make it hard to discount this type of redevelopment in the long term.

		<title>Polar Bear is a &#034;Threatened&#034; Species--US</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=194</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/administration-polar-bear-threatened-but-co2-not-relevant/">US Department of Interior today announced</a> that it would list the polar bear as a "threatened" species in line with its requirements to carry out the dictates of the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/laws/lawsdigest/ESACT.HTML">Endangered Species Act</a>.  Once a species is on the list, the government is committed to insuring that the species itself and its habitat is granted a significant level of protection.

Since the polar bear is threatened because of the loss of sea ice in the arctic, and the sea ice loss is directly attributable to anthropogenic global warming, it would seem that this ruling makes it imperative that the federal government regulate GHG emissions.

Of course, this flies in the face of the Administration's instincts, so the Secretary of the Interior basically said that GHG regulation would be off the table--even though it is responsible for habitat degradation.

I haven't read the <a href="http://www.doi.gov/issues/polar_bears/Polar%20Bear%20Final%20Rule_to%20FEDERAL%20REGISTE%20-Final_05-14-08.pdf">entire 368-page rule [.pdf] </a>that explains the rationale for designating the polar bear as threatened, but it is significant that it cites the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other mainstream reports of climate science as authoritative.  This represents--at least on a modest level--the US government's acknowledgment of the reality of climate change in an official, legal document.

On the other hand, since the Secretary was quite clear about not doing anything about protecting polar bear habitats, the listing may not have any practical affects on policy.

The folks at <a href="http://climateprogress.org/2008/05/14/bye-polar-kempthorne-polar-bear-is-endangered-but-rule-will-allow-continuation-of-vital-energy-production-in-alaska/">Climate Progress have a similar view</a>.  It also looks like the environmental groups that initially forced the DOI to consider the listing <a href="http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/index.php/csw/details/polar_bear_esa_implementation_ghg/">are planning on continuing the legal battle</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US Department of Agriculture Warns About Climate Change Effects</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/27/AR2008052702639.html?hpid=topnews">Washington Post reports</a> about the publication this <a href="http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap4-3/default.php">week of a new study</a> by the US Department of Agriculture that synthesizes research on the impact of climate change on US agriculture, land and water resources and biodiversity.

The report has some dramatic findings.  Of over 1500 species studied, 60% have been affected by climate change.  Increases in wildfires, decreases in mountain snowpacks impact species habitats while increasing temperatures have been found to have a profound impact on crop maturity.

The study was part of a series of <a href="http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/default.htm">synthesis and assessment reports</a> that are being conducted under the direction of the US Climate Change Science Program.  Generally these reports are conducted by teams of independent and government scientists, which perhaps inhibits the Administration's penchant for toning down climate change science.

Some of the reports to be released in the next couple months should be interesting to watch.  Sometime in the next couple of days a report should be issued looking at the <a href="http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap4-6/default.php">effects of climate change on human welfare</a>.  Later in the fall the program will release a <a href="http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap5-2/default.php">report on how the government should convey "uncertainty"</a> in climate science reporting and policy decision making.  Given the deliberate strategies on the part of the Administration to exploit the natural element of uncertainty in the scientific method, this report should be closely watched.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Low Price of Petrol in the United States</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The New York Times is loaded with important environment-related coverage.  From an article about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/business/30coal.html?ref=business">challenges associated with building clean coal</a> power plants to a discussion about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/business/worldbusiness/30food.html?ref=business">ongoing global debate</a> on biofuels and food scarcity, many issues are covered today.  Also of note are articles on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/business/30nuke.html?ref=business">controversies surrounding nuclear power</a> and climate change and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/washington/30climate.html?_r=1&oref=login&ref=us&pagewanted=print">results of the latest lawsuit against the Bush administration</a> to release a <a href="http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/scientific-assessment/Scientific-AssessmentFINAL.pdf">synthesis report[.pdf]</a> on global warming.

What struck me, however, was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/business/30fuel.html?ref=business">an article on recent protests over fuel prices</a> in Europe.  Much like the US, there have been political pressures for governments to reduce costs by limiting taxes.  French President Nicholas Sarkozy, for example, wants the European Union to impose a cap on the amount of fuel taxes levied by member countries, while other European leaders recognize that reducing the tax burden would not necessarily result in lower prices and would likely increase social costs.

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/Bartling/UntitledAlbum/photo#5206185160525961762"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/Bartling/SEAV0egPWiI/AAAAAAAAAhs/gcpVWMmllUo/s400/fuellarge.jpg" /></a>

The graphic above is suggestive as it shows different levels of taxation in the EU.  What is interesting, however, is the relative low percentage of taxes in the US and Canada.  The article indicates that the higher tax burdens in Europe were imposed after the oil shocks of the 1970s and were dramatically successful in encouraging a decrease in consumption.  Expansion of public transportation was made possible by the increased resources and consumers chose fuel-efficient cars.

In the US we have not had significant social investment in transportation alternatives. And although petrol prices are resulting in a <a href="http://fastlane.dot.gov/secretarysblog/2008/05/fhwa.html">decrease in vehicle miles traveled</a>, comparing the US to Europe suggests that taxes are still too low in this sector.  Higher prices--with the caveat that the funds generated go to public transportation enhancement--could dramatically enhance the viability of multi-modal transport systems in the US.]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/world/europe/13paris.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">New York Times had an article</a> yesterday assessing the first year of Paris' bike sharing scheme,  Vélib.  Comprised of more than 20,000 bicycles located at 1500 stations, there have been 27.5 million trips recorded over the last year in a city with a population of 2.5 million.

Individuals can get inexpensive subscriptions (€29/year) for the service.  With numerous stations situated throughout the city, consumers essentially "check out" a bike and return it to a station proximate to their destination.

The system was financed privately by <a href="http://www.jcdecauxna.com/pages/Default.aspx">JCDecaux</a>--an outdoor advertising firm--which maintains the bikes and stations and shares some revenue with the city.

There was <a href="http://bike-sharing.blogspot.com/2008/02/jcdecaux-chicago.html">some talk</a> over the <a href="http://westnorth.com/2007/08/01/bike-share-not-news-to-city-hall/">past few months</a> about Decaux instituting a similar system in Chicago, but I'm not sure of the proposal's status.  In the meantime, check out <a href="http://blog.velib.paris.fr/blog/">le blog  Vélib et moi</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With $4.00/gallon petrol and growing awareness of climate change and problems with food safety, it appears as if a grassroots movement of urban/suburban gardening is taking hold in the US.This appeared on the radar earlier in the spring when the <a href="http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/may/27/grow-it-yourself/">nation's largest seed company reported</a> twice as many sales over last year's figures.  Perhaps folks are taking seriously <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/magazine/20wwln-lede-t.html?ex=1366344000&en=2a96d8eede8f11cb&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">Michael Pollan's plea</a> made in April for gardening as a small--but significant--way to address climate change in the face of government inaction.

Regardless, it is interesting to see folks like <a href="http://alamedasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3574&Itemid=14">Julia Park Tracey of the Alameda Sun</a> link the contemporary gardening resurgence with the national, organized Victory Garden efforts of the last century.

While those gardening movements were done in the name of national security, the current planetary threat of climate change is clearly just as pressing.  Perhaps the time has come for a politicized gardening movement to commence?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Al Gore <a href="http://www.wecansolveit.org/content/pages/304/">made a speech today</a> laying out a set of policy initiatives to deal with the problem of energy insecurity and climate change.

His speech was a bit lacking in detail but most significantly he is proposing a shift to 100% electricity production from renewables in the next decade.  He argues that this is achievable and can be realized by upgrading the nation's electricity grid, a by instituting a carbon tax (offset by payroll tax decrease).  Most of the speech's emphasis was on generating overwhelming popular support to compel government to act.

While a decade-long conversion to renewables is admirable, it will undoubtedly be a long slog given the fact that in 2007 only 9% comes from non-renewable sources.
His call for a Marshall Plan-type of effort could have leverage politically but it will require more specificity from a policy standpoint.

Gore is supposedly going to be making the Sunday talk show circuit, so it will be interesting to see how the Obama and McCain campaigns react to the surge in publicity around climate change over the next couple of days.

Gore's carbon tax proposal probably won't have much leverage, but an emphasis on large-scale investment in renewables could be wedded to other efforts (such as increases in money for public transit) to form a compelling platform for a candidate like Obama.  McCain's recent endorsement of business-as-usual policies around the gas tax and offshore drilling makes it seem unlikely that we will see any visionary policies stemming from his camp.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Al Gore is at best unrealistic.  Understand that he is poised to make hundreds of millions of dollars from the carbon cap and trade scheme (he runs a brokerage business that takes commissions from the trades), that the cost of going to full electric would be devastating to the economy and that achieving it requires thousands of new nuclear power plants.  To propose that this could be done within a decade is irresponsible, and in truth positioned to enrich Gore's investments in companies that will benefit from government subsidies.  Gore's speeches are not unlike what Boone Pickens is doing with windmills ... they are creating public opinion momentum to support government subsidies and support for their current and future investments.

While I agree that McCain has little vision in the energy debate (Obama would be better characterized as naive), it is important to appreciate the financial motivation of the most visible proponent of taxing carbon - Al Gore.  If it were Exxon promoting this, everyone would look to see how they were profiting.  Why is Gore exempt from this review?  Objectively review his business interests at Generation Management and Kleiner Perkins to verify this, then try to make the claim that his intentions are altruistic.  His income has already skyrocketed from the CO2 hoax.

Close to 100,000 scientists have now come out with signed statements in disagreement to the IPCC claims.  Where will this leave those who continue to claim "scientific consensus" when only 1100 government-hand-picked scientists signed the IPCC report, and many of those have since retracted their support due to manipulation of the data by government agencies.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>British Tidal Power Turbine Comes Online</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://image.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2008/07/17/SeaGen460.jpg" />

The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jul/17/waveandtidalpower.renewableenergy">Guardian is reporting</a> that the SeaGen tidal power turbine is now contributing to the UK electricity grid.  The turbine, located at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, is currently generating 150kW, with an eventual capacity of 1200kW.

Tidal turbines are essentially underwater windmills.  The energy from tidal forces is captured by the turbine, making it a promising renewable source.  Unlike wind, tidal forces are much more predictable.

Offshore renewables are often criticized by environmentalists for aesthetic reasons and for the potential impact on marine habitats, but the relatively small footprint of SeaGen has assuaged many concerns.  In addition to the Northern Ireland project, Marine Current Turbines (the firm behind the technology) is <a href="http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/02/08/environmentalists-back-tidal-scheme-91466-20450284/">planning an installation in Wales</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Gordon Brown&#039;s Ecotown Scheme Faces Setback</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over a year ago, <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=105">I posted</a> on Gordon Brown's ambitious plan to create a dozen or so new, "eco-towns," throughout the England as a way to deal with issues of affordable housing and environmental sustainability.

In the intervening months, <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/ecotownsprospectus">Brown's scheme</a> has failed to take off.  Earlier in the year, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/apr/03/greenbuilding.energyefficiency">government published a list</a> of 15 sites where the potential new towns would be built, with the caveat that the number would be whittled down to 10 sometime this summer.  Upon publication, many communities in the vacinity of the proposed towns <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/protesters-fury-as-ecotown-shortlist-targets-unsustainable-locations-804531.html">erupted in opposition</a>, arguing that the development would deprive regions of valuable greenspace and would not necessarilty contribute positively to regional sustainability.

The towns are dependent upon public/private partnerships for their development and yesterday plans for the town outside of Cambridge were nixed <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jul/17/ecotowns.greenbuilding">as a key landowner refused to sell undeveloped property</a> essential for the new town.

This comes on the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5d37f148-46d4-11dd-876a-0000779fd2ac.html">heels of protests at Westminister</a> last month and <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/943dcf70-460a-11dd-9009-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1">opinion polls suggesting</a> a lack of enthusiasm for Brown's scheme.  As Brown's approval ratings <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL278293820080627">continue to be dismal</a>, the prospects for the eco-town scheme are not bright.

While on the surface, new town construction on ecologically sustainable terms makes sense, it is unclear why <em>new</em> towns are preferable to green, infill development.  That might have been a more palatable way of dealing with issues of housing and sustainability.]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.westernclimateinitiative.org/">Western Climate Initiative</a> was launched last year by the governors of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington to coordinate efforts to minimize carbon emissions as a result of inaction at the federal level.
Similar inaction at the Canadian federal level resulted in the various provinces joining the WCI.  With Ontario's participation, over 70% of Canada's population will be covered by a cap and trade scheme.

Negotiations between the WCI partners have been ongoing about how the system will operate and details about the scheme should be released in a matter of weeks.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When regulatory agencies determine the parameters for a new rule or regulation to insure public safety, cost-benefit analysis is performed.

Abiding by rules requires costs to be incurred by private entities.  The federal government takes into account what the costs might be and weighs those against the benefits accrued to the public by regulation.

The cost-benefit analysis involves making esitmates that are based on particular assumptions.  In the case of the Environmental Protection Agency, they regulate harmful pollutants and make determinations on the economic benefits accompanying regulations insuring particular levels of health and safety.

Compounds such as smog-forming ozone and particulate matter are byproducts of industrial processes, yet too much of them in the atmosphere can result in premature deaths.  Accordingly, the EPA places a literal value on the lives that could be saved based on levels of restrictiveness of regulations.

The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/18/AR2008071803235.html?hpid=topnews">Washington Post reports </a>that the EPA has decreased its estimate for a life's worth to $7.22 million from $8.04 million. The effect of this change will be a loosening of regulations on pollution while the administration can still make dubious claims about protecting public safety.]]></content:encoded>

One byproduct of the housing bubble was speculative acquisition of agricultural land on the exurban fringe by developers with the plan to build residential or commercial properties on the former farmland.

With a shift in economic fortunes, the FT discusses how developers are actually selling this reserve land back to farmers, resulting in a sort of "reverse sprawl."  Does this presage an agricultural reclamation of suburbia?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Cheney Nixes Cabinet Push to Regulate Greenhouse Gases</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The US House Select Committee on Global Warming released its <a href="http://globalwarming.house.gov/tools/2q08materials/files/0110.pdf">report [.pdf]</a> on Friday looking into the Bush Administration's response to the <em>Massachusetts vs. EPA</em> Supreme Court decision which required the EPA to consider regulating greenhouse gas emissions.

Much of the report is based on the sworn testimony of James Burnett--an ex-Deputy Administrator at the EPA.  According to the report, there was agreement on the need to regulate greenhouse gas emissions amongst the professional staff of the EPA and the cabinet heads of relevant federal agencies (e.g. Transportation, Energy, Commerce, Treasury, etc).

The EPA did consult with industry and encountered opposition from Exxon Mobil and the industry lobbying group, Edison Electric Institute, regarding regulation.  These energy industry officials suggested that the administration refrain from issuing any regulations.

The congressional report asserts that Cheney's energy advisor, Chase Hutto III [<a href="http://www.publicedcenter.org/stories/resumes/DOE/Hutto_Chase.pdf">resume .pdf</a>], pushed the industry line within the White House and, inexplicably, the EPA and cabinet officials reversed their support for GHG regulation.

The report has gotten little notice in the media, except for the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121659608477668919.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">Wall Street Journal</a> and a blog post at the<a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/presidentbush/2008/07/cheney-global-w.html"> LA Times</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7511356.stm">BBC has an insightful report</a> on how climate change is effecting the community of Cherrapunjee, India.  Located in the northeastern part of the country on the border with Bangladesh, Cherrapunjee has consistently been one of the world's wettest places.

The report discusses both how annual levels of rainfall have been declining in Cherrapunjee as well as the seasonal shifts in the rain that they are getting.  These shifts cause havoc on agricultural production and contribute to deforestation as inhabitants try to survive in the context of decreasing agricultural productivity.  Of course, more deforestation makes matters worse for greenhouse gas buildup as well as soil fertility.

These types of stories are getting played out throughout the globe as communities adapt to drastically changing climate conditions.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US Green Party Nominates McKinney/Clemente Ticket</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's too easy to poke fun at third parties in American politics.  Given the institutional and cultural biases for our current two-party system, it is enticing to toss off parties such as the Greens and Libertarians as well-meaning cranks, rather than groups of people committed to important agendas that are ignored by the major parties.

That said, I am not sure if the Greens did themselves any good by nominating Cynthia McKinney and Rosa Clemente as their presidential ticket.  This morning, <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2008/7/21/first_all_women_of_color_presidential">Democracy Now, interviewed the two candidates</a> and they did little to impress.  Aside from Clemente's McCain-like equation of Iran and Iraq--she called for an "immediate withdrawl from Iran" of US troops--the most revealing aspect of the McKinney/Clemente ticket is a lack of concern for environmental issues.

One would think that a Green Party candidate might have something to say about climate change, for instance. Nothing was mentioned.  Water quality, conservation and allocation? Nothing.  Worker and consumer safety from environmentally destructive products and practices?  Nothing.

It would be a lot easier to take the Greens seriously if they actually focused on core environmental issues. They could also have more impact in the larger policy debate with this approach.  Nominating less-than-serious candidates like McKinney does little to help their cause.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/business/27view.html?_r=1&ref=business&oref=slogin">Sunday's New York Times</a>, Princeton economist Alan S. Blinder, wrote a column advocating for a federal "Cash for Clunkers" environmental/economic stimulus law.

Perhaps because my car is 18 years old and has logged 204,000 miles, I found his proposal intriguing.  Given the fact that older model cars are significant contributors to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, the cash for clunkers program would give owners of old cars a cash payment of 20% over the Blue Book value to get them off the road.

Blinder also proposes that an income cap on eligibility be established to limit costs and insure that low-income people (who likely drive older cars anyway) can take full advantage of the subsidy.  People could use the money for whatever they want.  In many cases, one would expect, another, newer car would be purchased injecting cash into the economy and resulting in an aggregate decrease in harmful emissions.

This is not a new idea.  <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/Sustainable_Transportation/Vehicle_Scrappage_Program-WSF8711200-1_En.htm">Canada is initiating a similar program</a>, beginning in January 2009 and <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/06/30/news/economy/retire_cars/?postversion=2008063014">Texas already has a program </a>giving a $3,500 rebate for a new car for eligible trade-ins.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Proposed Car Sharing Scheme in Paris</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On the heels of Paris' <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=197">successful bike-sharing program</a>, Vélib, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/world/europe/29paris.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">city is proposing</a> a variant using cars: Autolib.

Details have yet to be worked out--particularly with regard to financing--but the idea is similar to Vélib.  Users would "check out" a car from one station and drive it to their destination across town and deposit it at another station, paying only for the time that they were using the vehicle.

Here in Chicago, we have a couple of pretty successful car sharing schemes, the non-profit <a href="http://www.igocars.org/">I-Go</a> and the for-profit, <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/">Zip Car</a>.  However, both of these programs require the user to deposit the car at the originating location.  I can certainly see the advantage of the Autolib scheme--you don't have to pay for the vehicle when it is sitting idle.

Of course, it could also result in higher levels of use (and more traffic) as it could theoretically allow more efficient use of a single car.]]></content:encoded>

According to the article, there is little consensus on the amount of lithium reserves on the planet (<a href="http://www.evworld.com/article.cfm?storyid=1472">check the debate at EvWorld</a> for more background).  However, it is a limited resource and this fact alone should be taken into account by policymakers as shifts from fossil fuels are pursued.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Gulf of Mexico Dead Zone Near Record Size</title>

The phenomena occurs as a result of nitrogens used for fertilizers in industrial agriculture running off into the Mississippi River and its tributaries, becoming concentrated as the river empties into the gulf.  The expanding hypoxia zone kills off fish and wreaks havoc on local economies dependent on healthy fisheries.

The fact that the hypoxia zone is expanding should be a national scandal as it is a product of wholesale pollution stemming from the lack of any effective environmental regulatory regime for industrial agriculture.  As climate change brings about higher temperatures, the <a href="http://epa.gov/msbasin/taskforce/2006symposia/146justice.pdf">phenomenon is likely going to get worse [.pdf]</a>.

I haven't heard either presidential candidate offer a solution to this expanding national disaster, but it was a positive development yesterday when the Bush Administration's Agriculture Department <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/business/30conserve.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">took an uncharacteristically rational  position</a> by refusing to allow farmland uncultivated for conservation purposes to be brought into production.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Obama Releases &#034;New Energy for America&#034; Plan</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the US Presidential campaign heats up, candidates are starting to develop more specific proposals on pertinent issues.  Yesterday, <a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/newenergy">Barack Obama released his New Energy for America</a> plan.

Here are the highlights as I see them:
<ul>
	<li>Cap and Trade: He advocates for reducing US greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 1990 levels.  This is an ambitious target and one that exceeds the <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jMW9slv8dnUNu4_fa4Wz0-GLsH3AD91PMUMG0">G-8 agreement</a> last month for a 50% reduction.  He also wants to auction 100% of the emissions credits and use the money for research into renewables as well as to provide rebates for consumers to shift to low-carbon technologies.</li>
	<li>Increase fuel efficiency in vehicles by 4% per year and put 1 million plug-in electric vehicles on the roads by 2015.  GHG emissions stemming from the transportation sector are significant and it is a good idea to reduce them.  However, a shift to electric cars could have the opposite effect since in many areas of the country coal is the major source of electricity.  More electric cars would place greater demands on fossil fuel electricity generation.  The other problem with these fuel efficiency schemes relates to the current financing structure of higway construction and maintenance.  The federal highway trust fund raises revenue by a tax on fuel.  With higher efficiency vehicles, there is less revenue raised.  Additionally, the costs of driving are lower with greater efficiency which could lead to greater use.  Greater use plus lower revenues is not necessarily sustainable.  Obama offers little disucssion in how his energy plan would effect this revenue stream.</li>
	<li>He does end the plan with an acknowledgement of the need to "build more livable and sustainable communities."  This is light on specifics, but he claims to be "committed to reforming the federal transportation funding and leveling employer incentives for driving and public transit."  A coherent urban development and transporation strategy would be significant in reducing a dependence on fossil fuels.  Obama doesn't offer such a strategy here, but it is a positive step that he at least acknowledges the connection on at least a superficial level.</li>
</ul>
Like most politicians, Obama is a bit too bullish on bio-fuels, failing to address the environmentally problematic aspects of their production, the massive subsidies that go this sector through the Farm bill,  and the tariffs on imports that artificially rasie their prices.

On the whole his plan is decent--clearly a dramatic break with Bush's harmful actions and more coherent than McCain's shifting positions on the topic.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Obama;

I hope Your policies never ignore gravity as energy resources. To understand gravity, just stand up and try to jump one meter up. You can't do that. Is it not energy?

An attempt made by means of new innovation now converts 3 joules of gravitational energy into electrical energy in each second. The device is a converter but not generator. I am now working towards manifyiying this effect. If you are interested in this amazing result, I am happy to communicate.

Cheers,

Bunaro]]></wp:comment_content>

With high petrol prices here to stay, the question becomes: when will political leaders adequately address this historical imbalance?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bloomberg Calls on New York to Produce Renewable Energy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mayor Michael Bloomberg is furthering his ambitions for making New York a more sustainable city by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/20/AR2008082003663.html">calling for the city </a>to more aggressively pursue local, renewable energy production.

In a speech in Las Vegas earlier this week, he expressed a desire to make the city sustainable in its energy production by pushing wind and tidal turbines and solar power projects.  Although, he has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/markets/2008/08/21/wind-turbine-closer-markets-equity-cx_ra_0821markets35.html">backpedaled a bit on his proposal</a>, the idea that you can have smaller-scale energy production by deploying wind turbines on skyscrapers and bridges and solar panels on thousands of rooftops throughout a city is an innovative approach.

Many of the current renewable proposals use the same large-scale industrial mode of thinking that characterizes fossil fuel production: big solar and wind farms in thinly populated western states.  These proposals face numerous challenges, the least of which is developing the transmission line capacity needed to move the electricity to urban consumers.
A decentralized, urban approach, however, could be less intrusive and require less massive bits of infrastructure.  Having thousands of buildings generating a percentage of their electricity on-site in a city could have tremendous impact in reducing carbon emissions and lowering energy prices.

Cities can also develop larger projects as well.  <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/fresh-kills-new-yorks-next-wind-farm/">The New York Times local politics blog has an intriguing proposal</a> for turning the recently closed Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island into a wind farm.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The New York Times has two articles today discussing the problems with essential elements of the US infrastructure.

The first is a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/business/27grid.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">front page discussion</a> of the electricity grid and how the lack of capacity for electricity transmission is causing problems for renewable energy development.  There are plenty of places where wind energy in particular could be effectively and profitably generated--they just happen to be in places where not a lot of people live.  The transmission grid structure has essentially remained stagnant for the past two decades and sites with promise for wind generation are not well-served.

One problem that is highlighted in the article is the fact that states have tremendous regulatory power over grid siting, construction, and maintenance as well as over utility prices.  Without federal incentives, the article suggests, states with cheap sources of electricity production may be unenthusiastic about price hikes that might accomopany exporting energy to distant states.

The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/business/27fund.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">second article discusses the emergent trend in cities to sell off infrastructure</a> to investment banks in exchange for short-term capital infusion.  Here in Chicago, Mayor Daley has deployed this strategy, selling off the Chicago Skyway and proposing to sell Midway Airport.

In a similar situation which faces the electricity infrastructure, we are seeing a crisis in the maintenance and expansion of essential transportation amenities in cities and metropolitan regions.  As in the case with the electricity grid, this largely stems from the absence of a concerted federal policy to address the problem.

For cities, their only choice seems to look to private capital for financing.  While privatizing a highway or airport might temporarily free up municipal budgets for other things, there are numerous problems involved with relying on privatization as a strategy for insuring a functioning transportation network.  Elements that may not be profitable for private capital--but which are essential for a functioning network--are likely to be ignored.  Additionally, issues of equity are apparent as privatization is also generally accompanied by higher user fees for roads, airports, and transit.

What is missing in both transportation and energy policy is a logical, coordinated, federal policy.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Planned Community: Prairie Crossing, IL</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have published several papers on planned communities and have a long-standing interest in looking at the tensions between the visions of planners and the ways in which everyday people relate to the economic, social, and cultural elements of these planned spaces.

Often planned communities are derided for their social and cultural "inauthenticity" and their contribution to ecologically unsustainable sprawl.  Some planners, however, have been trying to address these issues and build in a more environmentally-friendly fashion.  Prairie Crossing, in Grayslake, Illinois is an interesting attempt in this regard.  <a href="http://www.terrain.org/unsprawl/9/">Terrain.org did a good story</a> a few years back about its origins, but, briefly, the community was developed self-consciously to respect natural ecosystems.  Any develompent of this size will undoubtedly come up short in solving all of the environmental problems associated with the intractable problems of suburbanization, but in a 677-acre site, the developers did an admirable job.

I visited there a few days ago and, in an effort to continue some experiments I've been doing with google maps, I will post below a modest "virtual interactive tour."  Clicking on the blue points will bring up pictures and commentary.  The map can be <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=113069632163166060946.00045614317a559fdf911&ll=42.329489,-88.014994&spn=0.027475,0.053902&z=14">linked to directly on google's website</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[US Transportation Secretary Mary Peters <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/05/AR2008090503525.html">is appealing to Congress </a>for funds to replenish the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund.  The fund gets its revenues from a 18.4 cent per gallon tax levied on petrol purchases and is the major conduit for federal money going to state and local highway and transit projects.

Because of high fuel prices, <a href="http://www.cattlenetwork.com/Content.asp?ContentID=248095">gasoline consumption has declined</a> over the past year resulting in revenue shortfalls for the fund.  Because the tax is a fixed, higher pump prices do not necessarily mean higher revenues.  Furthermore, when consumers purchase fuel-efficient vehicles they pay less taxes per mile driven yet still require well-maintained and expanded highways.

This financial situation suggests larger structural imbalances in the financing system for roads and highways.  When gas prices were relatively low, enough revenue was generated to meet costs; but when prices got high enough to impact demand, the system shows its faults.

Peters' running to Congress for money to fill the gap should remind us of what could have happened had John McCain's insane idea to create a "gas-tax holiday" generated more steam.  The budget shortcomings could have been even more severe and with more consumption, the urgency of highway maintenance and expansion would have been more pronounced.

With his elevation of a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/palin-the-real-scandal-920803.html">climate change denier</a> to be his potential Vice President and his embrace of crackpot schemes to weaken the country's transportation infrastructure, McCain is doing little to suggest he is serious about confronting some of the country's pressing policy challenges.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Sarah Palin on Climate Change: Flip-flop or Incoherence?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Much to my surprise, Charlie Gibson of ABC news, in his interview with John McCain's vice presidential candidate, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, pressed the candidate on the issue of climate change.  McCain has expressed some concern about climate change in the past and at <a href="http://www.pewclimate.org/policy_center/analyses/s_139_summary.cfm">one point sponsored a cap-and-trade bill</a>.  Palin, on the other hand,<a href="http://www.newsmax.com/headlines/sarah_palin_vp/2008/08/29/126139.html"> has denied the anthropogenic factors influencing climate change</a>, placing her radically out of step with McCain, her own party, and scientific consensus.

In the interview with Gibson, however, she appears to (maybe) have changed her tune.  Here is the relevant section of the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=5795641">transcript:</a>
<blockquote><strong><em>Sarah Palin on Climate Change:</em></strong>

GIBSON: Let me talk a little bit about environmental policy, because this interfaces with energy policy and you have some significant differences with John McCain. Do you still believe that global warming is not man-made?

PALIN: I believe that man's activities certainly can be contributing to the issue of global warming, climate change. Here in Alaska, the only arctic state in our union, of course, we see the effects of climate change more so than any other area with ice pack melting. Regardless, though, of the reason for climate change, whether it's entirely, wholly caused by man's activities or is part of the cyclical nature of our planet -- the warming and the cooling trends -- regardless of that, John McCain and I agree that we gotta do something about it and we have to make sure that we're doing all we can to cut down on pollution.

GIBSON: But it's a critical point as to whether or not this is man-made. He says it is.  You have said in the past it's not.

PALIN: The debate on that even, really has evolved into, OK, here's where we are now: scientists do show us that there are changes in climate. Things are getting warmer. Now what do we do about it. And John McCain and I are gonna be working on what we do about it.

GIBSON: Yes, but isn't it critical as to whether or not it's man-made, because what you do about it depends on whether its man-made.

PALIN: That is why I'm attributing some of man's activities to potentially causing some of the changes in the climate right now.

GIBSON: But I, color me a cynic, but I hear a little bit of change in your policy there. When you say, yes, now you're beginning to say it is man-made. It sounds to me like you're adapting your position to Sen. McCain's.

PALIN: I think you are a cynic because show me where I have ever said that there's absolute proof that nothing that man has ever conducted or engaged in has had any affect, or no affect, on climate change.</blockquote>
On the surface she <em>seems</em> to have shifted her position: "I believe that man's activities certainly can be contributing to the issue of global warming."  When pressed by Gibson on her weasel words, she asserts: "I'm attributing some of man's activities to potentially causing some of the changes in the climate right now."

Her deployment of a rhetoric of uncertainty makes it seem like she is on board with science, without repudiating her previous claims.  One would think that a politician from a circumpolar region would have more command of the science and policy of climate change, but she gives little confidence that this is the case.

Friday, September 19, 2008 is <a href="http://www.parkingday.org/">National Park(ing) Day</a>.  Inspired by the project implemented in San Francisco a few years ago by the artistic collective, <a href="http://www.rebargroup.org/">Rebar</a>, communities throughout North America and the United Kingdom are going to temporarily reappropriate public space currently used for automobile parking by erecting temporary parks.

The motivation is simple--too much of our public space in the US is singularly dedicated to harboring cars.  Here's a back of the envelope calculation:  according to the <a href="http://www.transportchicago.org/images/IntelligentBus-LaMantiaEmmanuel.pdf">City of Chicago [.pdf]</a>, there are 3,800 miles of streets in the city.  A standard width for an on-street parking space is about 9 feet.  Assuming parking on both sides of the street, the city has approximately 8290 acres of on-street parking.  If this were park space it would exceed the current park space in the city by 13%!

On National Park(ing) Day, people put grass, benches, and trees in parking spaces, providing another understanding for what parking might mean in the city.

In Chicago, the national cosponsor of National Park(ing) Day, the <a href="http://www.tpl.org">Trust for Public Land</a>, will be transforming parking spaces on the 1800 block of N. Milwaukee Avenue into parks.  Please join them in this effort to reclaim public spaces in the city!

		<title>Palin Confirms She&#039;s Clueless on Climate Change</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the unique aspects of the US federal system is the autonomy that states have in many areas of public policy.  Many governors use this autonomy to exhibit leadership in addressing the pressing concerns facing their state.  We have seen this in the case of California, for instance, with Gov. Schwarzenegger's <a href="http://presszoom.com/story_145998.html">proactive policies </a>on climate change.

One would think that in the case of John McCain's VP choice, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, she would exhibit a similar concern.  Circumpolar regions like Alaska have seen the <a href="http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=fe119b52-78d7-413f-880d-d6c1ba1965ee">most immediate and deleterious effects</a> evidenced by the dramatic ice melts in recent years.  Rather than being proactive about the issue and being a national voice advocating for federal policies, it appears that Palin doesn't even understand the issue.

Her response in tonight's debate was remarkable for its incoherence:
<blockquote>I'm not one to attribute every man -- activity of man to the changes in the climate. There is something to be said also for man's activities, but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet.

But there are real changes going on in our climate. And I don't want to argue about the causes. What I want to argue about is, how are we going to get there to positively affect the impacts?

We have got to clean up this planet. We have got to encourage other nations also to come along with us with the impacts of climate change, what we can do about that.</blockquote>
How can you avoid "arguing about the causes" to develop a policy response?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j5TrmqRTOY1LFhtuJcy2dj7DudJQD93GJ2K80">trying to bounce back from dismal poll numbers</a> over the past several weeks.  After staving off a mutiny at the hands of Labour backbenchers at <a href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/special_reports/conference/">last week's party conference</a>, Brown engineered a shakeup of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7648551.stm">his cabinet</a>.

One result was the creation of a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/oct/03/climatechange.energy">ministry for energy and climate, headed by Ed Miliband</a>.  From an organizational standpoint, linking the two under the same portfolio makes sense, since fossil-fuel dominated energy sources will undoubtedly affect climate change.  Thinking about both the power supply, grid, and the externalities simultaneously could result in more efficient development in the energy sector.  I don't know too much about <a href="http://www.edmilibandmp.com/">Miliband</a>, other than, of course, his brother is Brown's Foreign Secretary, <a href="http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/roller/miliband/">David Miliband</a>, the point-man for international climate change negotiations under former Prime Minister Tony Blair.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Hugh,

It might help to explain to your students that cautious optimism plays better to a British audience than outright celebration :-)

Having lived and worked in Silicon Valley for over a decade, I am very aware of cultural differences when people receive good news:
in California, it is much easier to embrace change, see opportunities, and work to realize dreams than in other areas of the world;
by contrast, in Britain, there is pervasive cynicism and initial reactions to positive announcements are often treated with scorn, then reasons for potential failure are listed and discussed, often leaving problems unsolved!

FYI: I have been adding reactions to news of the new government department DECC as it becomes available to me.  This has been welcomed by the CBI (Confederation for British Industry), SDC (Sustainable Development Commission), REA (Renewable Energy Association), Carbon Trust and environmental groups so far.

Now I am keeping an eye out for reactions from key players in the energy sector (generation and distribution, not transport), and will post those when possible.  The big bright spotlight is on Mandelson, the new head of BERR—people are surprised and fascinated by his return, and there's plenty to talk about—so it's up to bloggers to draw attention to the creation of DECC, and point out that UK energy policy is no longer the responsibility of BERR and Miliband will not be reporting to Mandelson!]]></wp:comment_content>

Located in a distressed neighborhood in Kingston, Jamaica, this projects marks and interesting internationalization of the New Urbanist design principles.

I've visited the Prince's first planned development, Poundbury, and found it to be a compelling urban space, nicely integrating with the village of Dorchester.  It is eminently walkable with a few shops and pubs and flexible public spaces.
The Jamaican project may a bit more challenging if it is to meet the aspirations of New Urbanism given the severe socioeconomic conditions apparent in the Kingston neighborhood targeted for redevelopment.

A subtext of New Urbanism planning is the "universal" nature of good design principles.  But what will be the interface of these principles when they encounter intractable poverty, violence, and limited economic development?  Furthermore, how "universal" are these principles given their resurgence within a particular Anglo-American context?  Can New Urbanism be applied in Jamaica by the Prince of Wales without <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=4czssHWv4K0C">accounting for the history of colonialism</a>?]]></content:encoded>

Interestingly, longtime cycling advocate and initial sponsor of the bill, <a href="http://blumenauer.house.gov/">Rep.

The details on how the arrangement will work are sketchy, but the idea seems to be to enhance smooth transitions between modes.

Of course, a larger issue that needs to be taken up in Chicago is a universal fare card that links the CTA and Pace with the Metra commuter rail system.  This technology is customary in many European and Asian systems--but <a href="http://sicktransitchicago.blogspot.com/2007/10/take-it-to-bank-universal-fare-card.html">has failed to move forward in Chicago</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>EU To Water Down Emissions Targets?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/oct/09/energy.climatechange">Guardian is reporting</a> that next week's meeting of EU leaders may result in backing down from their previous commitment to automatically increase their greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in the event of a global agreement on a successor to the Kyoto Protocol.

Originally, the EU said they would commit to a 30% reduction of emissions by 2020 if an agreement is signed.  The article contends that the current financial crisis may be used as a screen to justify a less agressive emissions reduction policy.

It will be interesting to see how this materializes--especially given the impending change in a US administration that may be more sympathetic to agreeing to binding targets.  It should make the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change meeting this December interesting to watch.  <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">The conference</a>--to be held in Poznań, Poland--will be the arena where particular details of a post-Kyoto agreement will be hashed out.  Given the fact that the global financial crisis does not appear to be subsiding any time soon, it will clearly influence the proceedings.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Nader to Voters: Choose Liberal or Green</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ralph Nader, independent candidate for President of the US, apparently isn't able to break through the US consciousness in this election cycle and has instead involved himself in tomorrow's Canadian election.

The <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081013.wnader1013/BNStory/Front">Globe and Mail reports</a> that Nader is urging Canadian voters to choose either Liberal or Green when they go to the polls tomorrow.  With <a href="http://www.thestar.com/FederalElection/article/516626">Steven Harper's Tories poised to continue</a> their anemic rule as a minority government, Liberal leader, <a href="http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/decisioncanada/story.html?id=c2328d67-5d5a-494e-a610-aa54cd5eed15">Stephane Dion is still trying to persuade </a>left-leaning Canadians to support his party's platform, which has a <a href="http://thegreenshift.ca/default_e.aspx">federal carbon tax</a> as its centerpiece.

Green leader, Elizabeth May, has actually invoked Nader by claiming that she learned a <a href="http://www.thestar.com/FederalElection/article/506436">"lesson from the Ralph Nader story - where Ralph Nader went wrong is - what I will never do, which is to say that there is no difference between all the those other bad guys and that we are the only good party."</a>

Some of <a href="http://www.winnipegsun.com/News/Canada/2008/10/13/7069866.html">her supporters</a> are setting up <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/group.php?gid=25808609138">internet vote</a> <a href="http://www.votepair.ca/">trading schemes</a> whereby people living in ridings with insurmountable Tory support will "trade" their Liberal vote with Green supporters in tighter races.

Curiously, there is no mention of Nader's Canadian endorsements on his own website.  Somehow, I don't think Nader's position will matter much in either race.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7670934.stm">Nothing surprising happened</a> in yesterday's Canadian election.  The Conservative Party of Prime Minister Stephen Harper increased its hold on seats in Parliament from 127 to 143, keeping them short of the <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/election-2008/story.html?id=880047">elusive 155 seats</a> needed for a majority.

It appears that the big loser is Stephane Dion and the Liberals.  <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2008/10/15/nb-graham-carbon-tax.html">In an interesting story regarding their three-seat loss in New Brunswick</a>, the CBC speculates that it was Dion's heralding of a carbon tax that contributed to their decline.

Given the fact that New Brunswick Premier Shawn Graham has himself been promoting a carbon tax scheme in the province, it seems likely that he might shift his priorities somewhat following the federal result.

It will be interesting to keep an eye on the future of Liberal leader, Stephane Dion.  Not surprisingly,<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20081015.ELECTIONLIBSSB15//TPStory/National"> calls are being made for his ouster</a>.  How a new leadership fight <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20081014/election2008_carbontax_081014?s_name=election2008&no_ads=">might affect the party platform on a carbon tax</a> will be important to watch.  It doesn't appear promising given the amount of attention Dion paid to the issue.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>EU Summit--Are Emissions Targets on the Cutting Board?</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=229</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2008 15:35:11 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Hugh Bartling]]></dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=229</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Trying to find a common European stance on emissions targets is a little bit like trying to pin down the S&P 500.  After eight of the newer, Eastern European, EU members (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia) <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7672335.stm">objected</a> on Wednesday to fulfilling previous greenhouse gas emission commitments due to the "high economic cost," they were joined by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who threatened to veto the emissions targets.  On the other hand, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British PM Gordon Brown argued that current economic uncertainties should not derail action on climate change policy.
Here are the main sticking points:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52008DC0030:EN:NOT">The plan</a> agreed upon earlier in the year has an aim of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in its emissions trading scheme by 20% from 2005 levels by 2020.  The objectors want the base to be 1990 since most of these countries<a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.eea.europa.eu/pressroom/newsreleases/eu-greenhouse-gas-emissions-decrease-in-2005/table-1&imgrefurl=http://www.eea.europa.eu/pressroom/newsreleases/eu-greenhouse-gas-emissions-decrease-in-2005&h=425&w=571&sz=45&hl=en&start=13&um=1&usg=__aqX3FmhhqJbQd46qY5iInKeb79Q=&tbnid=VO2noJMYuVfYAM:&tbnh=100&tbnw=134&prev=/images%3Fq%3Deu%2Bemissions%2Bdata%2Byear%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DN"> had lower levels of GHG</a> emissions in 2005.</li>
	<li>The plan also calls for an expansion of the scheme to include gases other than CO2 and more affected industries with auctioning of emissions allocations occurring in key sectors--namely, the power sector.  The objectors are either against auctioning or want the date for auctioning to begin to be pushed back.</li>
</ul>
In the end, the leaders issued a <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_applications/applications/newsroom/loadDocument.ASP?cmsID=221&LANG=EN&directory=en/ec/&fileName=103441.pdf">statement [.pdf]</a> saying that the "European Council confirms its determination to honour the ambitious commitments on climate and energy policy which it approved" earlier in the year and hope to have, by December, "appropriate responses to the challenge of applying that package in a rigorously established cost-effective manner to all sectors of the European economy."

I'm not sure that really clears up matters!  Although, immediately following the summit, UK climate change minister, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/16/greenpolitics-edmiliband">Ed Miliband, announced</a> that the government endorsed the <a href="http://www.theccc.org.uk/">Committee on Climate Change's</a> recommendation to cut UK emissions by 80% from 1990 levels by 2050--a most ambitious target.  This will likely be used as a point to pressure recalcitrant countries into agreeing to strong commitments as the negotiations continue through December.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Call for Caution on Cellulosic Biofuels</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With rising fuel prices accompanied by rising food prices, the use of ethanol as a substitute for fossil fuels has come under increasing scrutiny.  The price of many basic foodstuffs have risen over the past several years as the fuel producers are pushing up the demand for corn.

As a way to get out of this fuel or food quandary, the notion of encouraging the development of "cellulosic biofuels" has garnered widespread support.  Everyone from <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2007/02/22/bush_cellulosic/">George Bush</a> to <a href="http://www.communitytimes.com/default.asp?sourceid=&smenu=67&twindow=Default&mad=No&sdetail=6569&wpage=&skeyword=&sidate=&ccat=&ccatm=&restate=&restatus=&reoption=&retype=&repmin=&repmax=&rebed=&rebath=&subname=&pform=&sc=1049&hn=communitytimes&he=.com">Barack Obama</a> have pushed for the development of cellulosic biofuels.  The purported advantage of cellulosic ethanol is that it does not require food inputs.  It can be produced using <a href="http://gas2.org/2008/03/07/first-cellulosic-ethanol-plant-goes-online-makes-fuel-from-wood-waste/">"wood waste"</a> and grass.

Therein lies the problem.  The environmental website <a href="http://news.mongabay.com/2008/1016-hance_quaranda_interview.html">Mongbay features an article</a> on the connections between cellulosic biofuels and deforestation.  The article centers around an interview with North Carolina environmental activist Scot Quaranda of the group, <a href="http://www.dogwoodalliance.org/">Dogwood Alliance</a>.  They argue that the forest industry already is exploiting Southeastern US forest resources at an unsustainable rate and that the rhetoric equating cellulosic ethanol as using "waste" is misleading.

In many current forest product manufacturing facilities, according to Quaranda, the amount of waste is minimal.  If the government adopts plans like Obama's--which is to capitalize a $50 billion investment fund--this could result in incentives to <a href="http://www.biomassmagazine.com/article.jsp?article_id=2050">expand the definition of wood waste to include fallen biomass</a> as well as to prompt further deforestation.

Such policies could have the effect of decreasing the capacity of forests to act as carbon sinks, aggravating climate change, and destroying forest habitats for birds and mammals.  Looking at the full spectrum of consequences for these new biofuels programs should be mandatory when assessing some of these policy initiatives.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Fine Print Behind the EPA&#039;s &#034;Strong&#034; Lead Regulation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday, to general praise (e.g. see the Sierra Club Executive Director, Carl Pope's <a href="http://sierraclub.typepad.com/carlpope/2008/10/getting-it-righ.html">"Getting it Right at the EPA"</a>), the Environmental Protection Agency issued regulations that would <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hcTiajsMbtTpHkg16H1A-rJW69tgD93RO4100">"slash the amount of lead allowed in the nation's air by 90%."</a>

The lead emissions regulations had not been updated for thirty years and were badly in need of revisiting due to the real harm that lead exposure can have on children especially.  Given the Bush Administration's enthusiasm for polluters, on the surface, this endorsement of strong reduction is unusual.

This set the folks at OMB Watch to look at the issue a bit closer.  <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/article/blogs/entry/5460/24">Matt Madia suggests</a> that the regulations may mean little given the erosion of the EPA's monitoring system over the past two and a half decades.  In addition, <a href="http://ombwatch.org/article/blogs/entry/5455/24">there appears to be some problems in how compliance is measured</a>.  The current method is to look at emissions over a three month period and compute a daily average that emitters must meet.  EPA scientists wanted to shrink the period to one month, which would make it impossible for polluters to have prolonged periods of emission.

I haven't had the chance to read the <a href="http://epa.gov/air/lead/actions.html">413 page rule</a>--but it appears that looking carefully at how this thing is actually going to be monitored will be essential in order to fully assess the effectiveness of the rule's supposed "strength."]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bush Snubs Palin? Beluga Whale Designated &#034;Endangered&#034;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a post earlier today, I expressed some healthy skepticism about the EPA's historic strengthening of lead emissions rules, feeling that the Bush administration has a less than stellar track record when it comes to enforcing federal environmental laws and that the rule left some wiggle-room when it comes to monitoring.

Well, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/18/us/18beluga.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">tonight comes word</a> that NOAA has issued a rule listing the beluga whale as an endangered species.  These whales populate the Cook Inlet in Alaska and have been at the forefront of a politicized debate in the state relating to the impact that such designation would have on resource extractive industries.

In Alaska, all of state's major politicians--including <a href="http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/wildlife/marine/story/382922.html">Gov. Sarah Palin</a>--have been against the designation given their general antipathy towards any governmental measures that might inhibit the energy industry.  Thus, this designation is surprising--regardless of the fact that during the public comment period, NOAA received 180,000 comments, of which 90% supported listing the beluga as endangered.

Perhaps the fact that the sub-agency in charge of making the designation, the National Marines Fisheries Service, is run by an actual scientist made the normal Bush political tomfoolery less difficult to pursue.  The <a href="http://federalregister.gov/OFRUpload/OFRData/2008-25100_PI.pdf">rule looks pretty clean</a>[.pdf], making the next step in the quest for protecting the beluga the development of a habitat protection plan over the next few months.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The head of the United Nations' effort on climate change, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed7/idUSTRE49G78W20081017">Yvo de Boer, expressed concern</a> at the turmoil surrounding greenhouse gas emission targets that accompanied the meeting of EU leaders this week.

Ever the diplomat, de Boer, expressed confidence in French President Nicolas Sarkozy's ability to re-forge an EU agreement before the <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_14/items/4481.php">next major international meeting</a> to be held in Poland in December.

One would think that the EU leaders would be able to put something relatively concrete together.  The fact that the meeting is taking place in Poland--which has been critical of strong EU emissions reduction agreements--will likely place pressure on the Polish government to step back a bit from its recalcitrant position.  The outcome of the US election also will likely influence the emergence of a unified EU position.

The fact that both McCain and Obama have campaigned on different variants of a cap-and-trade policy could give the EU leverage to advocate for a strong plan that has a chance of being accepted as part of a post-Kyoto agreement.  But they have to get their own house in order first.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What the Bailout Money Could Have Bought for the Environment and Society</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The $750 billion bailout of banks in the US and the millions of more euros, pounds, yen and kronor going to save financial institutions <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/oct/17/marketturmoil-climatechange">prompted John Vidal at the Guardian to ask</a> what that kind of money could do to help save the environment.

His list is interesting:
<ul>
	<li>The Stern Report warned that $540 billion annually is needed to forestall the worst effects of climate change.</li>
	<li>The protection of the world's forests, watersheds, oceans, mountains, and seas would cost only $45 billion annually</li>
	<li>The article cites <a href="http://knol.google.com/k/-/-/15x31uzlqeo5n/1#">a study by Google's climate change guru, Jeffery Greenblatt,</a> that estimates $4.4 trillion over 30 years to switch US energy from fossil fuels to renewables.</li>
	<li>To provide all of the people in the world with clean and safe water would only cost $64 billion.</li>
</ul>
Here are a couple of my own (not necessarily environmental) back of the envelope calculations:
<ul>
	<li>The US bailout package money could build 25,000 miles of light rail.  That would be the equivalent of 73 systems identical in size to the New York City subway.</li>
	<li>$750 billion could pay for 31.5 million people to go to a <a href="http://www.collegeboard.com/student/pay/add-it-up/4494.html">private university in the US</a>.  There <a href="http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/012084.html">are about 18.4 </a>million people enrolled in both private and public universities.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Obama vs. McCain on Climate Change</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Andrew Revkin of the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/us/politics/19climate.html?partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">has a good article today</a> comparing the climate change policies of the two US Presidential candidates.  Here's a capsule summarization of the main differences:
<ul>
	<li>Both are proponents of a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, but differ in their goals.  Obama wants a reduction of 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.  McCain wants a 60% reduction.  Obama's target is in line with the growing scientific consensus that <a href="http://april.stepitup2007.org/article.php?id=29">80% global reduction is required to stave off</a> the most hazardous scenarios.  It is also in line with targets announced by Britain last week.</li>
	<li>Obama wants to auction emissions credits.  McCain seems to want to give them away with possible auction in the future.  Obama will use a portion of the proceeds earned from the auction to fund his venture capital scheme that encourages private sector development of renewable energy technologies.</li>
	<li>McCain wants to build 45 nuclear reactors by 2030.  Obama wants to shift to renewable energy sources, with a goal of 25% of the country's energy coming from renewables by 2025.  The 25% by 2025 threshold has been adopted in Great Britain.  The <a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR384-1/">RAND Corporation recently completed a study</a> on how the US would get to this point (namely, through wind and biofuels).</li>
	<li>Both candidates are committed to the UN process for developing a successor to the Kyoto Protocol--although the key preliminary discussions are taking place in December, so Bush's climate curmudgeons will be leading the US delegation.  Nevertheless, there will be ample opportunity for the new US president to shape the talks as the final agreement is targeted for completion in December, 2009.</li>
</ul>
In sum, Obama is in line with most of the industrialized world on climate policy.  McCain is lagging behind.  Additionally, the fact that his running mate (who McCain describes as <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,434841,00.html">"one of the foremost experts in this nation on energy issues"</a>) is an anti-science climate change denier and that he wants to put her in charge of energy policy suggests his lack of commitment to the issue.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/19/AR2008101901533.html?hpid=topnews&sid=ST2008101901645&s_pos=">Washington Post has an interesting article</a> on the stress being placed on water systems as a result of anthropogenic climate change.  Most models predicting the extent of future risk insist that more extreme precipitation events are likely.

As a result, sewage and purification systems will come under greater stress.  The effects of this on antiquated water management systems will likely be significant.  Under these scenarios, floods will become more frequent and municipalities will have to dump large amounts of raw sewage directly into water sources.  This, in turn, increases the risk of E. coli and cryptosporidium outbreaks.  More standing water and hotter temperatures will also provide a more attractive habitat to mosquitoes, facilitating the spread West Nile, dengue, and malaria.

The article points to an element of the climate change problem that is often ignored in the US: namely, the costs of adaptation.  This element receives <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20081019-167180/Global-warming-fund-sought">a lot of attention in international discussions</a>, as less developed countries, which are already facing policy challenges stemming from climate change, argue for more development aid to be dedicated to adapting to changing circumstances.

In the United States and Europe, adaptation has not really been on the agenda.  Our water management systems are generally more resilient than those in the less developed world; but in many areas of the country, expansion has been <a href="http://www.estormwater.com/-1-Billion-Could-Fund-New-York-Water-Sewer-Upgrades-NewsPiece14156">deferred or inadequate</a> to meet current demand.  If we are to expect more extreme weather events as a result of increasing carbon emissions, finding mechanisms for adaptation is something to take seriously.

Curiously, neither Obama nor McCain have adaptation on their respective climate change agendas.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>EU to China and India: Cut Emissions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[European Union environment ministers are meeting this week to hatch together some kind of agreement for greenhouse gas emission reduction in time for December's UN-sponsored meetings.

After a revolt from the newer, Eastern, member states (helped along by Italy) the latest tenor of the conversation has been to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/oct/22/climate-change-carbon-emissions">place demands on China and India</a> to reduce greenhouse gases by 15% from "business as usual" levels.

This appears to be the first time that the EU has so publicly floated targets for developing countries.  Once the Bush Administration came around to accepting the reality of climate change, its official stance was to reject mandatory emissions reductions unless India and China went along with a reduction plan.  The EU largely kept quiet about the Bush stance while India and China protested, saying that any scheme requiring them to reduce emissions was unfair, given the carbon footprint of Westerners and the fact that the historical accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere came almost exclusively from Western countries.

If the EU winds up taking a more aggressive stand towards China and India, it should make things interesting in December.  At that point the EU would be moving towards a more Bush-friendly stand, but a new US President will be immanent.  Whomever wins the presidency will be planning on having a high-profile role as the post-Kyoto framework is developed.

In this US leadership void, the EU stance in December will become key in setting the agenda for the 2009 agreement.   A strong stance towards China and India will likely be embraced by the next President, while a strong Western country reduction target will test the commitment of either Obama and McCain.

Both have said they want the US to take an active role in the UN discussions, but I have not heard either candidate say anything about their stance on requiring India or China to reduce emissions.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Suburban Election</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tomorrow the United States has its Presidential election.  Contrary to Sarah Palin's argument that the "real America" is embodied in small towns like her home of Wasilla, Alaska, the election is going to show us the continuing power of metropolitan areas in general and the suburbs in particular.

Over the last several election cycles, suburban voting has been at the forefront of defining the national political mood.  Newt Gingrich's 1994 "Republican Revolution" was built on a Sunbelt suburban support and the Republican leaders of the 1990s like Gingrich himself, Tom DeLay, and Dennis Hastert.  George W. Bush capitalized on these Republican gains and found large pockets of support in suburban and exurban districts throughout the country.  The 2006 elections--where the Democrats won back Congress--was a harbinger of the shift in suburban political attitudes.  Here in Illinois, Melissa Bean of Lake County set the stage in 2004 with her upset victory over longtime Republican Phil Crane.  The trend continued in 2006 as Democrats like John Yarmuth of Kentucky and Harry Mitchell of Arizona defeated right-wing Republicans in largely suburban districts.

Tomorrow's election for President and Congress will likely be decided in suburbia, as well.  Obama is running well in some of the states with the highest levels of suburban growth, such as Nevada, North Carolina, and Virginia.  A look at the CQ Politics analysis of House races shows that a large proportion of the seats where incumbent Republicans are vulnerable are in suburban areas.

If Obama wins and the Democrats secure their predicted gains in the House it will be relatively clear why suburbanites shifted their preference to Democrats.  First, the mortgage crisis has hit suburban communities particularly hard.  While inner-city communities have been devastated by the crisis, <a href="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/kbenfield/the_geography_of_foreclosures.html">Kaid Benfield shows how the geography of the crisis</a> is quickly making its presence known in suburbia.

The mortgage crisis is just one symptom of a larger economic malaise hitting the middle classes that includes wage stagnation, rising energy prices, the tanking of market-based pension accounts, and a decline in purchasing power.  With McCain's shaky response to the credit meltdown that followed his irrational push for a "gas tax holiday," suburban voters have reasonably questioned Republican competence in economic matters.

Secondly, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-03-03-immigrant-assimilation_N.htm">suburbia has become much more diverse economically and ethnically</a> over the past decade.  This poses a couple of problems for the Republicans.  Economic diversity means that suburbia is no longer characterized by middle- to high-income residential enclaves.  Municipal fragmentation and metropolitan expansion has shifted the metropolitan distribution of lower-income families to suburban areas.  Suburbs have become, in a sense, more "urban" and its residents are more inclined to sympathize with Democratic arguments about tax reform and social programs.

The increasing racial and ethnic heterogeneity we see in suburbs, furthermore, makes the racist undercurrents of McCain's less effective and will likely push voters towards the Democrats.

What does this mean for the next president?

If Obama is elected and Democrats increase their gains in the suburbs, I would argue that he will have an opening to completely reinvigorate the federal role in metropolitan development.  On the campaign trail he has been persistent about arguing for "green jobs," "infrastructure development," "energy independence," and a response to the climate crisis.  These all could be synthesized in a federal Smart Growth policy.

Obama does pay lip service to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/10/AR2008081001839.html">Smart Growth in his energy plan</a>, but if he pushes it front and center and shows how sustainable metropolitan development can improve economic opportunities and the quality of life for the vast majority of Americans living in cities and suburbs, it could be a way for Democrats to solidify their gains in these important geographic areas.]]></content:encoded>

The study utilizes foreclosure data coupled areal photographs from 2007 showing a preponderance of swimming pools filled with stagnant water.  This suggests the pools were not being maintained and constituted a breeding ground for mosquitos. It is difficult to track precisely where mosquitos contracted West Nile, but the study suggests another problem to watch out for as more suburban homes fall into disrepair as a result of the housing crisis.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My wife and i made it down to the center of the political universe yesterday:  Grant Park, Chicago.  A beautiful night with unseasonable temperatures around 18C, we biked from my office in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood south through River North, over the Chicago River and through downtown to Printers' Row.  There were lots of cyclists, families, groups, and solitary folks taking advantage of the weather and relatively light auto traffic.  City officials closed much of the central core to cars, making cycling a breeze.

After meeting friends for a couple of drinks and dinner at <a href="http://www.villainschicago.com/home.html">Villains</a> on south Clark we headed over to Grant Park.  Villains, of course, had their televisions tuned to election coverage and we were there when both Pennsylvania and Ohio were called for our local hero.  Our friends were lucky enough to have scored passes for the ticked event in Hutchinson Field where Obama was to speak to supporters.

For the rest of us, the campaign set up at least a half a dozen large television screens in the northern section of Grant Park.  We walked our bikes from Villains down Michigan Avenue, but found that the street was so packed with people taking in the atmosphere that we decided to lock the bikes up a block east on Wabash.

<img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/SRHC-gdp-YI/AAAAAAAACq4/8vFAp_fHaYw/s320/IMG_1013.jpg" />

Free from our vehicles, we walked across Michigan Avenue into the park to join the scene.

<img alt="Grant Park 4 Nov. 2008" title="Grant Park 4 Nov. 2008" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/SRHCbyu_y2I/AAAAAAAACiE/_kguaIlA4Zo/s320/IMG_0944.jpg" />  Vendors were everywhere, hawking bootleg Obama shirts, buttons, pictures to an appreciative and relatively subdued crowd.

As we crossed the Metra Electric tracks and entered the park, we followed the crowds to the various video screens, hoping for an update on any new states called by the networks.

<img title="Grant Park 4 Nov. 2008" alt="Grant Park 4 Nov. 2008" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/SRHCfzSFAXI/AAAAAAAACjA/8yth94bVQ-Y/s320/IMG_0951.jpg" />

The crowd was in extremely good spirits and reflective of the great diversity of the city.  Attendees were mostly young, but there was good representation of of people from all walks of life.

<img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/SRHCh2M61CI/AAAAAAAACjg/PgH0EV5hP-w/s320/IMG_0955.jpg" />

Many of the video screens were almost hidden away in the various copses that dot the park.  With the size of the crowds and the presence of the trees, we moved around trying to find a good view of the screens.

As we crossed over Columbus Drive, we heard cheering from all directions.  It appeared that CNN was calling Florida for Obama, all but insuring victory for our junior Senator.

<img alt="Grant Park 4 Nov. 2008" title="Grant Park 4 Nov. 2008" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/SRHCjHgzpyI/AAAAAAAACjw/QwO3VZSBDBg/s320/IMG_0957.jpg" />

We moved closer to another video screen as CNN called the race for Obama.  The time had come!  Si se puede!

People were celebrating, cheering, and dancing--a great collective expression of hope for the future and a recognition of the historical importance of the moment.

<img alt="Grant Park 4 Nov. 2008" title="Grant Park 4 Nov. 2008" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/SRHColZ3wUI/AAAAAAAAClY/rkanwKFbTDI/s320/IMG_0970.jpg" />

We moved out of the landscaped portion of the park onto Jackson Boulevard where an extremely large video screen and unobstructed views made it an attractive place to park and watch Obama's immanent address.

<img alt="Grant Park 4 Nov. 2008" title="Grant Park 4 Nov. 2008" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/SRHCr4uZj6I/AAAAAAAACmM/Jo_h3osJaqI/s320/IMG_0976.jpg" />

After a couple of minutes mingling, and waiting in anticipation, John McCain appeared on the screen and gave his concession speech.  While it was a decent and respectful speech, it was difficult to reconcile with the rather shameful campaign he had run; a campaign of extreme cynicism that was built on exploiting fear, racism, and recklessness.  The people in the crowd listened, but I think it is fair to say that many were unmoved by his sudden contrition.

<img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/SRHCsG8v0qI/AAAAAAAACmU/6dZjubcInF0/s320/IMG_0977.jpg" />

Thankfully his speech is short and he rejected Sarah Palin's request to give a concession speech.  This crowd wanted to hear from the winner.

<img alt="Grant Park 4 Nov. 2008" title="Grant Park 4 Nov. 2008" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/SRHCuEIjipI/AAAAAAAACm0/hYu5kJHKMbg/s320/IMG_0981.jpg" />

As we waited for Obama to address us, I thought about the many times I wandered down the stretch of Jackson on which we were standing.  It is the main drag for many of Chicago's great festivals, like the Taste of Chicago and the annual Jazz Festival.  I remembered seeing the legendary Chicago tenor saxophonist, <a href="http://members.tripod.com/go54321/vf/vonfreeman.html">Von Freeman</a> on that same street just a few years ago.  Vonski is a Chicago icon--one of the best tenor players on the planet who played with Charlie Parker, Sun Ra, and Dizzy Gillespie.  Born in 1922, he is from that generation who consistently had to battle the indignities of Jim Crow and institutionalized racism, but in the face of such adversity contributed in mammoth proportions to the culture and vibrancy of the city.  I don't know where Vonski was last night (at his weekly gig at the <a href="http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/entity.php?id=5885">New Apartment Lounge?</a>), but I'm sure he was smiling.

I also thought about the late, great Studs Terkel.  The last time I saw Studs was in this same, Grant Park, just over a year ago.  The occasion was a rally to raise awareness of the health care crisis in this country and celebrate the release of Michael Moore's film, Sicko.  Studs was pretty frail, but gave a great endorsement of the idea that health care should be a protected human right.  He also expressed hope in the nascent candidacy of Obama.  As other speakers made the case for a single-payer health care system, Studs vigorously banged his cane on the ground, exhibiting the tenacity that he carried throughout his life.
I like to think of Studs' passing as purposively timed and that he had some sort of "inside knowledge" about the presidential race.  Playing the angles, Studs knew it was a safe bet to check out.  All these great memories in this great public space in this great city.
Finally, the video screens switched from the CNN feed to the in-house cameras from Hutchinson Field.  A great gospel rendition was followed by Barack, Michelle and their daughters appearing on the screen.  The throngs of people on Jackson Bvd. went crazy, and then quickly quieted down when Obama began his speech.

<img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/SRHCxmGU04I/AAAAAAAACns/aQP_eR35Eug/s320/IMG_0988.jpg" />

<img alt="Grant Park 4 Nov. 2008" title="Grant Park 4 Nov. 2008" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/SRHCzIn3T-I/AAAAAAAACoE/A5mU5eiaWMo/s320/IMG_0991.jpg" />

After the speech we stood on Jackson for a while, as the people around us headed west to leave Grant Park.  We eventually joined them, running into friends, students, and colleagues as everyone around peacefully left the park, psyched to help the new President change the country and change the world.  Confidence was everywhere.  Lets hope it lasts.  Congratulations President-elect Barack Obama!

		<title>Harper Hopes to Rope Obama into a North American Climate Change Deal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is interesting to see how the internal dynamics, political wrangling, and domestic one-upmanship of a country influences their external relations.

Case in point: the <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/531128">Toronto Star is reporting</a> that the recently re-elected Prime Minister of Canada, Steven Harper wants to "tackle [climate change] on the North American level," according to his Foreign Minister, Lawrence Cannon.  This means working with Obama on the issue "over the coming weeks."
This is interesting on a couple of levels.  Harper has been <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/kyoto/timeline.html">extraordinarily weak on climate change</a> and developing policies to meet their obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.  The (former) Liberal leader Stephane Dion ran on a pro-carbon tax platform last month and got decisively defeated.

Since Dion's major supposed appeal was his commitment to "green" issues, one can interpret these new overtures to negotiate with Obama as a way for the Conservatives to claim the environmental mantle in their quest to get a majority support in the country.   While the Conservatives made gains last month, they are still ruling as a minority government.

From Harper's perspective, he gets aggressive with Obama now, maybe banking on the fact that there will be little enthusiasm for a strong climate change bill in the US as the country heads deeper into recession.  Obama and Harper hash out a Kyoto-lite and next year's UN negotiations result in a weak treaty.  It doesn't help that the EU is engaged in their own internal debates about emissions reduction levels.

Obama, of course, has said that--unlike Bush--he wants to engage with the UN process and has adopted the strong EU levels of greenhouse gas reduction as his goals.  Could a Canadian gambit give him cover to skirt the issue during a time of economic uncertainty?  How much of his political capital will he want to expend dealing with climate change during his first months in office?

It will be interesting to see the people he puts in charge of climate change during the transition--as well as the key cabinet/executive positions of energy, the Council on Environmental Quality, State and the EPA.  How his transition team involves itself in the key UN Framework Convention on Climate Change meetings next month will also be something to watch closely.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UN Climate Chief: Obama Should Participate in December Talks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Global leaders are reacting swiftly to Tuesday's election of Barack Obama to the US presidency.

Yvo de Boer--the head of the UN climate talks--<a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iyYLgrQiAnllxEmWTTnaSmzhbo1Q">said yesterday</a> that he was "very encouraged" by Obama's election and that he hopes Obama "or his representatives can come to the climate change conference in Poznan" in December.

According to Agence France-Presse, de Boer acknowledged that he had been in touch with Obama's transition team before the election, meaning that the Poznan meeting is certainly on the President-elect's radar.

I highly doubt Obama himself will go to Poznan, but it certainly won't be a surprise to see him send some sort of liason.   Absent a visit from Obama, it will be interesting to see how senior of a person he sends and their interactions with the official US delegation.  At last year's meeting in Bali, there were numerous "free agent" US legislators--such as <a href="http://www.un.org/webcast/unfccc/2007/index.asp?go=05071210">John Kerry</a>-- who came and participated in an informal capacity.

The Poznan conference is a key meeting bridging last year's Bali conference which resulted in a global agreement to hatch out a successor to the Kyoto Protocol by next December.  The Bali Roadmap (as it was called) was pretty light on specifics with regard to emissions reduction obligations.  Poznan will get more into the details of what the final agreement might entail.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[According to an article in today's <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8e448942-af91-11dd-a4bf-000077b07658.html">Financial Times</a>, the newly-elected president of the Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed, is contemplating moving the country to avoid being reclaimed by the Indian Ocean.

The Maldives is a nation ecompassing 1,200 small islands with precious little land exceeding an elevation of 1.5m above sea level.

According to <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=6&q=http://www.rrcap.unep.org/reports/soe/maldives_climate.pdf&ei=J8AZSeeVB5ie8gT83aylDg&usg=AFQjCNEpX52XmC_JChaN2i4OYTS-7QozJg">UN research</a> [.pdf], there is a possibility that the entire country will be under water by the end of the century.  While Nasheed is contemplating purchasing land in Sri Lanka or India, they may want to consider New Zealand.  Last month, the <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/vote08/4730642a28435.html">NZ Green Party proposed liberalizing immigration quotas</a> to accomodate climate change refugees.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>European Transport Industry to Benefit from New US President</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/12/business/worldbusiness/12trams.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">New York Times has an article today</a> discussing the likelihood that the new US President will support increased financing for public transit systems and that European companies will be the beneficiaries.

It is not surprising that innovation in transit production is located outside of the United States, given the federal government's decades-long neglect of public transportation.

It is ironic that European companies are gearing up for big gains as an Obama administration re-thinks the logic of federal transportation financing while <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20081112/BUSINESS01/81112052">Democrats are simultaneously advocating for a bailout</a> of the US auto industry.

The degraded condition of the Detroit automakers is largely the result of their own inability to react to market trends and remain competitive with foreign automakers that have more fuel-efficient vehicle fleets.  Obviously, it would be too much to expect a company like GM to entirely reformulate its production--but the current situation is reflective of years of bad corporate and public policies that ought to be acknowledged.

Proposals like <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/economy-watch/2008/11/mikulski_deduct_interest_on_ca.html">Democratic Senator Barbara Mikulski's</a> to allow people to deduct the interest on their auto loans from their income taxes are likely to exacerbate the problem.  Investment in more ecologically-friendly forms of transport seems more sensible.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Obama Climate Advisor Expects a &#034;Very, Very Busy 2009&#034;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jason Grumet, a top Obama campaign adviser on climate issues told the <a href="http://www.pewclimate.org/events/carbon-market-insights-2008">Carbon Market Insights Conference</a> yesterday that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSTRE4AB84K20081112">we should expect a "very, very busy 2009"</a> on the global warming legislative front, suggesting that Obama is not going to put the issue on the back burner during his cruicial first year in office.

Grumet was not forthcoming about the specifics that Obama would like to see in legislation and the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/13/obama-environment-message-biden">Guardian's report</a> on the conference indicated that many in the climate change policy community were not as optimistic as Grumet.  Furthermore, <a href="http://newmexicoindependent.com/9846/bingaman-no-climate-bill-in-2009">Senator Jeff Bingaman</a>--chair of the Energy Committee--stated that his committee would not be able to pass cap-and-trade legislation until 2010.

It is hard to read the tea leaves, but it is interesting that Grumet was sent out as the first representative of the President-elect on climate.  He is a pretty middle-of-the-road analyst, having spent time as the head of the bipartisan  <a href="http://www.energycommission.org/ht/d/sp/i/490/pid/490">National Commission on Energy Policy</a>.  A look through their proposal for <a href="http://www.energycommission.org/ht/a/GetDocumentAction/i/1088">"Ending the Energy Stalemate"</a> [.pdf] reveals a cap-and-trade policy more in sync with McCain's plan than the one Obama advocated for during the campaign.

The Grumet plan calls for giving 95% of the emissions credits to polluters and selling 5% at first, with a "safety valve" mechanism allowing industry to purchase permits for $7 per metric ton CO2e.  Currently, on the European markets, a metric ton CO2e costs around $23, making the idea of a scarce and adequately priced cap unreasonable.   The plan also acknowledges that it would not meet the US obligations under Kyoto.

Obama's campaign platform included an adherence to the strict EU emissions reductions standards post-Kyoto and an auctioning process for permits.  Revenues from the auction would be used to invest in green technology start-ups.
The climate change landscape has changed a bit since 2004--particularly with studies such as <a href="http://www.occ.gov.uk/activities/stern.htm">Sir Nicholas Stern's 2006 report</a> estimating astronomical costs in the absence of strong caps on greenhouse gas emissions--so perhaps Grumet's views have changed.  But if you don't auction off emissions permits, you don't have the money to invest in green tech.

Otherwise, it will be interesting to see how Obama weighs the views of his advisers on this crucial policy issue.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bailouts and Transforming the US Auto Industry</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The New York Times dedicated the back of its editorial page today to various perspectives on how the US government should react to the Big Three automakers' request for a bailout.

I am sympathetic to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/opinion/16goodman.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">argument presented by Robert Goodman</a> that would link bailout money to a pledge by the Big Three to shift from being strictly automakers to being "transportmakers."  By this Goodman means that the automakers must "provide detailed plans to transform some of their factories into research and manufacturing centers for the development of light-rail cars and high-speed trains and buses."

In theory this is a good idea, but <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=244">as I argued in a post earlier this week</a>, the centers of innovation in mass transit production are largely situated in European, Canadian, and Asian firms.  I may be wrong here, but as far as I understand it, the Big Three have even largely gotten out of the bus market.  While Goodman points to the flexibility of the automakers in World War II to shift production from cars to airplanes, I am not sure how feasible it would be given the relative technical sophistication of contemporary production processes.  Furthermore, how much sense does it make to subsidize the Big Three just to get them "up to speed" given the fact that there are scores of other suppliers for transit technologies?

Certainly, the federal government should have a bit of leverage over the Big Three to require more socially-responsible production.  But it is not clear whether this plan would be the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars as the next administration seeks to reconsider investment in the public transit infrastructure.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm not so sure the problem is just quality. I had a bad Chevy minivan with serious problems, but I also have a 13 year old Buick sedan that has been a real champ for 175,000 miles.

The obvious problem with domestics vs imports is fit and finish of the interior cabin. The less obvious problem is that domestics have relied on profits from large vehicles like truck-based SUVs that used to sell well in the US, while imports have learned to build fuel-efficient cars that sell well everywhere.

The only US hybrid I could see buying is the Ford Escape &amp; Mercury Mariner, which seems to be the choice of a lot of politicians. The Malibu is a decent car, but offers only a enlarged-starter, "mild" hybrid. Most of the other US hybrids are ensconced in enormous SUVs.

The big three have made really poor choices and have so little expertise in small cars that they have to import and rebadge Daewoos and Opels.

Have you seen the rumor that China is about to make an offer for GM?

		<title>New Urbanism and the Foreclosure Crisis</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=248</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/business/16consumer.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">New York Times reporting</a> that personal bankruptcies have skyrocketed in the past few months and that many of the bankruptcies are related to people facing foreclosure in the fast growing Sunbelt states of Florida, Nevada, and California, I have been wondering about how the crisis has affected New Urbanism developments.

During the 1990s and early 2000s, New Urbanist developments were proliferating across North America--and were quite prevalent in the <a href="http://www.tndtownpaper.com/neighborhoods.htm">Sunbelt</a>.  For the uninitiated, "New Urbanism" refers generally to a design strategy that mixes land uses, utilizes a relatively high density form of development, and is built to accommodate multiple modes of mobility (public transit, walking, cycling).  One of the debates amongst New Urbanist theorists and practitioners centers around whether or not these communities have contributed to the sprawling conditions they are meant to counter.  If these walkable communities are isolated and are being built on the suburban fringe, aren't they just contributing to unsustainable patterns of regional development?  [As an aside, I would recommend <a href="http://architectureandplanning.dal.ca/planning/faculty/grant.shtml">Jill Grant's</a> recent book, <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=T6FcXLdLfq0C&pg=PP1&dq=planning+the+good+community&client=firefox-a">Planning the Good Community: New Urbanism in Theory and Practice</a></em>, which is a great primer on the movement.]

The foreclosure crisis has given rise to a whole host of related questions on New Urbanist development.  One theme, we have <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/06/16/suburb.city/index.html">seen in some news reports</a> is that traditional suburbia is dead.  High petrol prices, traffic congestion, and long distance commutes are making cities and urbanism the new choice for consumers.  This, of course, augurs well for cities--but what are the implications for New Urbanist developments?  Are they immune to the foreclosure crisis ?

I haven't seen any academic studies, but <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/columnists/orl-miket1608nov16,0,3381606.column">Mike Thomas of the Orlando Sentinel</a> had a thoughtful column yesterday on the eastern Orange County New Urbanist development, <a href="http://www.avalonpark.com/">Avalon Park</a>.  This development is a good example of a large New Urbanist community being built on the metropolitan fringe.  Internally, it has good design and development, but its integration into the larger metropolis is lacking.  As such, according to Thomas the community is suffering in the current crisis with large numbers of foreclosures and a decrease in home prices.

It would be interesting to see if other exurban New Urbanist developments are similarly feeling the pinch.  Also, how are the exurban developments stacking up to New Urbanist infill projects?  I would think that infill projects might be more resilient.  As a comparison, Baldwin Park--which is an infill project much closer to downtown Orlando--saw the region's <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/orl-real0308nov03,0,3801016.story">second highest number of closings</a> in the first half of 2008.  Obviously, the foreclosure crisis heated up over the summer, but these initial numbers suggest some resiliency.

In the absence of a systematic study of whether the exurban New Urbanist communities face smaller numbers of foreclosures than in conventional developments, it is hard to authoritatively comment.  However, I would speculate that these communities are not immune--and may even be more adversely affected--given their higher costs, making such communities less competitive in a sellers market.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Donal,  That clearly is the advantage in theory--the problem is how it works in practice.  Developers tout the amenities (shops, stores, etc...) in their sales materials, but many business owners are reluctant to open new stores in places where few people live.  People move in, but become disappointed when stores aren't there or are so specialty-oriented, they are of little everyday use.  Merchants, in turn, can't hold on until the critical mass develops.

The places where this tends to work seem to be either in 1) infill projects, 2) suburban developments near highways or high-traveled arterial roads, 3) where developers give merchants a heavy subsidy.

I haven't been to Orlando in a couple of years, but I have a friend who lives in Baldwin Park who tells me--anecdotally--that it is thriving.

The key, for me at least, is to link land use decisions with multi-modal transport infrastructure development.  That can only be done at the regional level--which is difficult given the power of municipalities in determining land use policy.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I live in Avalon Park.

While it's a hotspot for foreclosures, it also represents huge value, and is leading Orlando in new home starts; the turnaround does seem to be coming pretty quickly to AP, despite what Mike Thomas seems to think.

It's not really fair to use AP as an example of suburban sprawl, since Orlando in general isn't a hugely dense downtown surrounded by suburbs....these days, Central Florida is pretty much a giant neighborhood from the Space Coast to Tampa. I moved here from Atlanta 6 years ago, and was surprised to find my commute double. East Orlando,home to UCF and where AP is, is far enough away from Orlando that it's its own entity.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Chris,  Thanks for your first-hand report!  Keep us updated on what's happening down there.

I would have to disagree with your contention that AP is not an "example of suburban sprawl."  I used to work at UCF so I am pretty familiar with that part of Orange County.

What *precisely* constitutes "suburban sprawl" is clearly debatable.  However, the fact that AP was built on the eastern fringe of low-density development in the county and that the development itself is relatively low-density and not adequately integrated into a multi-modal transportation network makes it sprawl in my book.

The satellite image from google maps is telling.  The picture is undated, but if you zoom out you clearly see the community being constructed in an area surrounded by undeveloped land, on the fringe of Orlando's suburban morphology: http://tinyurl.com/65em4o

You are correct that Orange County is largely a "giant neighborhood"--although I would call it more of a giant suburb, with commuting and mobility patterns being dispersed throughout the county.  The reason that's the case is basically  due to a lack of regional planning and little significant efforts made at coordinating land use and transportation networks.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[US President-elect Barack Obama made a <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/11/in_surprise_speech_obama_promi.php">surprise videotaped address</a> to California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's <a href="http://site.governorsglobalclimatesummit.org/">Governors' Global Climate Summit</a> today.

In the address he reconfirmed his commitment to the emissions reduction plan developed during his campaign: a reduction of GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and a push to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.  He touted a cap-and-trade system as the mechanism to achieve these levels.

While not explicitly saying it, he seemed to confirm that he will auction off emissions credits and use the proceeds to invest, venture capital-style, in renewable energy entrepreneurs.  I <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=245">had expressed trepidation on this issue</a> last week given the views of one of his close climate advisers who seemed to favor giving emissions credits without charge to polluters.

He also mentioned next month's UN meeting in Poznan and noted that he will be receiving reports from "members of Congress" who are attending.

These are positive steps that indicate he is taking his campaign promise seriously as well as showing the international community that he is eager to be a positive contributor to the UN process of developing a successor to the Kyoto Protocol.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Site for Obama&#039;s Presidential Library</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, I know we may be getting ahead of ourselves, but <a href="http://leebey.com/blog1/2008/11/president_obama_how_about_pull.html">Chicago architectural critic Lee Bey has a great place</a> for locating Obama's presidential library:  Pullman.

For those unfamiliar with the site: Pullman was a model company town erected in 1880 by the eponymous rail car magnate.  As a way of solving the tensions between labor and capital, Pullman thought that if he provided adequate housing and a salubrious environment for his employees, they would be happy and productive workers.  He acquired land 12 miles or so south of downtown Chicago and built both a factory and worker housing.

The depression of 1894 put his experiment to a test that ultimately resulted in failure.  Declining orders for his rail cars caused him to reduce wages--however, most Pullman employees rented their homes from the company.  The company maintained rents, making it difficult for the workers to pay rent.  The result was a nationwide rail strike lasting for weeks.

Eventually the homes were sold to workers and the community was swallowed into the larger urban agglomeration of Chicago.  The company continued production (I think) at the facility until the 1970s.

In the intervening years the historic residential district has been pretty well-maintained by property owners, but the elegant factory building has been in a state of disrepair and is currently owned by the State of Illinois.

While I'm not sure about the symbolism of situating Obama with the rather tyrannical George Pullman, Bey makes a compelling case for having a presidential library at the site.

For one it is close to where the President-elect began his career as a community organizer, helping displaced workers adapt to changing economic realities.  Secondly, the factory building is a magnificent piece of architecture that has national and local historical merit.  Finally, it could provide a much-needed injection of capital in a neighborhood that could use some economic development.  Chicago has great tourist attractions, but the south side neighborhoods are largely ignored.

Come to think of it, a Presidential library in a working-class south side community might actually be THE great symbol for the Obama story.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[My class stopped at Pullman during a field trip to Chicago in the late 1970s. The Queen Anne row houses were interesting, but I recall the Hotel Florence, named for Pullman's daughter I think. It had some gorgeous interior woodwork. The place seemed fairly empty then. It had been home to a Moose Lodge, I think. I saw all these flyers, saying, "Moose members get more out of life!"]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Donal, You are correct on Florence, it was his daughter's name.  I haven't been down there for a couple of years, but at that time the Hotel had a restaurant and some offices for the local historical society.

I am pretty sure the restaurant is now closed.  Every couple of years you hear about a developer wanting to do something with the factory site, but they inevitably can't raise enough capital to bring their plans to fruition.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Emissions Permits On Sale Today!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The United Kingdom is <a href="http://nds.coi.gov.uk/environment/fullDetail.asp?ReleaseID=381652&NewsAreaID=2&NavigatedFromDepartment=False">held an auction today</a> for about 4 million permits to emit greenhouse gases.  Under the European Union cap-and-trade scheme, countries are shifting from distributing emissions permits for free towards auctioning.    Auctioning the permits allows the "true" value of emissions to be ascertained whilst simultaneously providing governments revenue.

Gordon Brown's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/nov/19/carbonemissions-emissionstrading">government is under fire</a>, however, as a result of its position of allocating revenue from the auction to its general treasury rather than to "green" projects.  According to a <a href="http://nds.coi.gov.uk/environment/fullDetail.asp?ReleaseID=384678&NewsAreaID=2&NavigatedFromDepartment=False">press release</a> from the UK government, the auction raised $81 million with each emission unit selling for about $20.

From the US perspective, it is interesting to note the criticism generated by Brown's decision to put the money into the general treasury.  The criticism stems from an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7736005.stm">assumption at the EU</a> that auction revenues will help finance the transition to a post-carbon economy.  This apparently is the norm in other EU countries, such as the Netherlands, and some <a href="http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2008/11/the-case-for-climate-change-earmarks/63009.aspx">European activists</a> are arguing that auction revenues should be allocated to adaptation funds for developing countries that will likely be part of the post-Kyoto global climate change agreement.

President-elect Obama's plan for a cap-and-trade scheme also uses an auction with a proportion of the revenues being dedicated to fund an independent venture capital organization which will invest in US low-carbon start-ups.  With a depleted federal treasury and a global agreement that will likely require the US to give climate adaptation aid to poor countries, it will be important to "follow the money" as the new President negotiates with Congress on a climate bill next year.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Obama Transition Releases Video on Climate Policy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of his address by video feed to the Governors' Climate Summit, Obama's transition team has released a <a href="http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/inside_the_transition_meet_the_energy_environment_policy_transition_team/">short video</a> on how the team is managing climate change policy.

Featured in the video are <a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/10/6/12441/2728">Heather Zichal</a> who was the main campaign staffer on the environmental policy desk and former EPA head, Carol Browner.

The video is light on actual policy, but I take it [along with yesterday's address] that climate change is near the top of the new administration's agenda.  The video features Browner talking about the need for integration across the various federal agencies in dealing with both energy and climate.  This is a positive orientation for tackling these policy issues--although realizing inter-agency coordination is often difficult in practice.]]></content:encoded>

According to the article, <a href="http://www.dwlogistics.co.kr/main/e_index.asp">Daewoo Logistics</a>, has signed a 99-year lease with Madagascar to build farms with the explicit goal of exporting the food to Korea.

I don't profess to be an expert on the natural and social ecology of Madagascar, but it is probably safe to say that <a href="http://hdrstats.undp.org/countries/country_fact_sheets/cty_fs_MDG.html">its ranking of 143 on the Human Development Index</a> indicates that the country is facing some structural economic problems.  With half the country's population denied access to a safe water source, <a href="http://www.wfp.org/country_brief/indexcountry.asp?country=450">65% of the population facing "chronic food insecurity"</a> (according to the UN's World Food Programme), and a GDP per capita of $923 annually, access to land and food are undoubtedly a problem for many Malagasay.

The article also seemed to imply that a "benefit" the country will be receiving from Daewoo is a plethora of infrastructure (i.e. roads).  This suggests that at least some of the land is isolated and, perhaps, currently forested.  The fact that the island is repository for biodiversity and has <a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=16509">long had problems with deforestation</a>, makes it troubling to think of the ecological impact this project might have on the country.

Also mentioned is the fact that this "outsourcing" of food production is gaining steam in other African countries, like Sudan and Ethiopia.  Unlike "traditional" globalization where firms extract resources to sell throughout the planet, this trend has a strong state component merging these new neo-colonialist-style arrangements in food security with state security.  Furthermore, the trend is being pursued by "less developed" countries like Korea and the Gulf States, further muddying up the terrain of possible geopolitical conflict.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the link, Donal.  I forgot to mention in the post that the original FT article about this deal indicated that most of the labor was going to be South African.  That doesn't seem to bode well for the Malagasy.

By the way, there is an under-appreciated documentary called "Mahaleo" that tracks a legendary Malagasy band that came together after the fall of colonialism in 1972 and was the voice of the spirit of progressive change in the country.

The band members eventually left music for a wide variety of public and social service jobs seeking to realize the spirit of the immediate post-colonial era.

The film documents their efforts to reunite, but places it within the context of the contemporary challenges facing the country.

Great music and a compelling film:  http://www.mahaleo.com/en/]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Illinois Tollway Authority Approves Congestion Charging</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-tollway-hotlanes-21-nov21,0,299213.story">Chicago Tribune reports</a> that the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority approved a $400 million scheme to introduce "green lanes" to selected portions of the tollway system situated around the fringe of Chicagoland.

The details on how the scheme will work in practice are sketchy, but it will likely involve dedicating lanes that could be used by both high-occupancy vehicles (which would pay the normal user fee) and single-occupancy vehicles (which would pay a premium).  The article suggests that the charge could fluctuate to meet demand making it cost more during times of high traffic.

This type of taxation is clearly the wave of the future and can be deployed to insure that users pay the true costs of travel.  However, there are some serious deficiencies in the Illinois scheme.

The primary problem is where the authority is going to invest the revenues from the charge.  The article indicates revenues will be used to pay off the Tollway Authority's capital improvement bonds and hence, finance the expansion of an automobile-centered form of mobility.

If congestion charging is going to be used to decrease air pollution and carbon emissions, it should follow the model of London and invest the revenues in low-carbon mobility options.  Illinois' system is simply going to create a two-tier system of users, with those willing to pay given the luxury of speedy travel and poorer people will have to put up with possibly more congestion.  Revenues, in turn, will be used to build more highways creating more low-density development, higher regional levels of vehicle miles traveled, and more overall energy use.

On the whole it looks like this scheme will be a social stratifying, carbon intensive sprawl inducer.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Donal, There are two reasons that this type of tolling is likely to be "sprawl inducing."

First, transportation is generally a function of land use.  We need to move through a metropolitan area to get to work, school, shops, etc...I agree that there are serious equity concerns--but without land use reform (which could be done indirectly by using the money generated to finance transit), automotive mobility will still be the norm.  Cash generated by this scheme seems to be dedicated strictly to Toll Authority operations, which means more highways.

Second, the main purpose of the High Occupancy Tolling is simply to reduce congestion by making the roads run more efficiently.  If prices are high during rush hour, users with flexibility will shift their use to cheaper times.  There won't be less use of the road overall--actually many economists argue that these types of tolling will result in MORE vehicle miles traveled, since prices will push more users to non-peak periods.

The debates about these tolling schemes have centered mostly around using the resource (i.e. roads) more efficiently and raise money for more highways--a necessity many states are facing because of the dire state of the Highway Trust Fund [a whole other can of worms that is going to cause the new administration some grief]!

Here is a link to a good GAO Report on highway congestion pricing: http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-06-554

Another, briefer, set of power point slides about an experiment proposed for Washington State: http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/2F68AF8F-A80C-4A2E-820C-5275D184787B/0/HighwayCongestion.pdf

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[OK, but who are these, "users with flexibility?" Many workers are already on flextime, many workers are already telecommuting and ordinary commuters have already played out the leave early/leave late game to the point where they barely see their spouses. I can see why HOV lanes may reduce the number of cars, but well-heeled individuals paying to use HOV isn't going to reduce congestion. It may even frustrate the people that are carpooling by increasing congestion in the HOV lane.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Great Lakes Wind Power: Problems and Promise</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If the move to a post-carbon economy is going to take place, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/apr/14/windpower.energy">many argue</a> that wind power will occupy a prominent place in the energy mix.  There are numerous challenges associated with increasing wind power generation--especially in North America.

T. Boone Pickens' <a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/business/story/1053439.html">grand plan for a massive West Texas wind farm</a> requires an upgrade of the transmission grid.  Getting the power from isolated parts of the country to population centers demands investment in capacity upgrades on the distribution end.

What happens, however, in instances where population centers are in close proximity to wind sheds?  Transmission costs may be minimized, but a greater obstacle may be evident: greater degree of public scrutiny and possible NIMBYism.  The <a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/541676">Toronto Star reports</a> on opposition to a proposed research project by Toronto Hydro to test the efficacy of wind generation in Lake Ontario.  While a possible wind farm would produce green energy, the article reports that residents are worried about the aesthetic and environmental impacts of a large industrial facility in the lake.

The Toronto experience will be interesting to watch, as the Great Lakes are a "natural" site for wind facilities.  The lack of topographic obstacles combined with population centers in the Great Lakes Basin, makes the region viable for wind power production from technical and economic standpoints.

While there has already been highly-publicized opposition to offshore wind projects in the US--most notably in the case of the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lGft3N1EqKYC">Cape Wind project</a> in Massachusetts--efforts to site relatively large projects near urban centers has not yet been tried.

With more concern over clean energy, however, this is likely to change.  In the Chicago suburb of <a href="http://www.cityofevanston.org/global/green/warming.shtml">Evanston</a>, for example, the city just endorsed a <a href="http://www.cityofevanston.org/global/green/documents/ECAP.pdf">climate action plan [.pdf]</a> outlining steps to meet Kyoto-level reduction targets. According to the plan, a 10 turbine wind farm situated several kilometers off shore in Lake Michigan could almost single-handedly meet the city's greenhouse gas reduction target.

Although opponents to such projects are given prominent space in media reports, there is evidence to suggest that public opinion is more complex.  On Massachusetts' South Shore, for example, a <a href="http://www.wbjournal.com/news41977.html">non-binding referendum supporting</a> offshore wind on this month's ballot was approved by an 87%-13% vote.

A Great Lakes Basin wind strategy might be a way to help ailing rust-belt economies, reduce US carbon emissions, and attract new industries to the region.  With a combination of fresh water and clean energy the rust belt could reinvent itself as the "green belt" with coordinated planning and investment.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Flora, There are undoubtedly impacts on marine and avian ecosystems associated with wind farms.  From my understanding of the literature, however, the flurry of studies has only begun in the past couple of years regarding the actual effects of wind farms.

Each proposed location will have different ecological properties that need to be taken into account. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that global warming is severely affecting marine and avian habitats; the sticky point is that the reduction of GHG emissions by substituting wind for fossil fuel may help some species while hurting others.

I don't about the reliability of the technology, but an alternative approach to substituting large fossil fuel projects with large wind projects might be to take a more decentralized approach to renewables.  Instead of concentrating renewable energy production in big off-shore or rural areas, have smaller scale generation widely distributed throughout cities, on top of buildings, etc...

This paper by Exo, et. al, "Birds and offshore wind farms: a hot topic in marine ecology" looks  like a good primer on some of the ecological issues.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Flora,

My wife and I attended an Audubon lecture on wind a few years ago. Not surprisingly, the speaker was concerned about birds and bats being killed, and complained that, in PA, Mighty Wind (my own term) was placing turbines right along ridges that avians regularly traversed. Of more import to me was that they also clearcut a large radius around each turbine, which has the effect of changing "deepwoods" forest areas into pock-marked border woods less suitable for the current wildlife. Also striking were their calculations that it would take thousands of turbines to equal the electrical output of a single PA coal-fired generator.

Every energy industry so far has operated strictly for profit, with disregard for their neighbors, the environment and the future. Unfortunately Mighty Wind seems no different.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>1,000 People Attend Meeting on Wind Farm in Toronto</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a previous post I mentioned the controversies surrounding wind farms in urban areas and--more specifically--on the Great Lakes.  According to the <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/542858">Toronto Star</a>, a meeting was held in Scarborough last night and was attended by 1,000 people.The site of the proposed study area is in Lake Ontario, approximately 2 km off the coast of Scarborough (which is essentially an eastern suburb of Toronto).

The article portrays the meeting as a classic NIMBY battle: residents of the immediate area expressing concern with the impact of the project against hundreds of "outsiders" bused in for the meeting.

Nothing was resolved at the meeting as it was simply an "open house" that the developer (Toronto Hydro) needed to hold to get approval for the <a href="http://www.torontohydroenergy.com/generation_offshore.html">initial study</a>.  Nevertheless, the <a href="http://torontoist.com/2008/11/wind_farm_pitch_brings_bluff_bluster.php">rancorous debate</a> depicted in the media reports suggests Toronto Hydro's path towards realizing a wind project in the area won't be smooth .]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UN Climate Change Conference Begins Monday</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=259</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tomorrow marks the start of the UN-sponsored conference on climate change in Poznan, Poland.  The conference will set priorities and a schedule for the upcoming year which will culminate in a global treaty to address climate change issues for the post-Kyoto Protocol period.

The <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_14/items/4481.php">Poznan conference</a> will last two weeks, with high-level ministerial meetings taking place around December 11.  Parallel to official negotiations are numerous press conferences, research presentations, and other lobbying by civil society groups.  Governments also use the conference to announce major "green" initiatives to bolster their position at the negotiating table as well as to influence public opinion in their home countries.

The UN has a nice website that offers <a href="http://copportal1.man.poznan.pl/">live streaming media</a> of many of the deliberations--including press conferences from the various official delegations and civil society groups, as well as a <a href="http://twitter.com/UN_climatetalks">twitter feed</a>.  I'll be following certain elements closely and offer daily posts as I did last year during the <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?cat=10">Bali talks</a>.  If readers have any tips on other web sites following the proceedings, please offer them in the comments.

As a preview, there are a couple of things to look for during the talks.  First, there will be considerable discussion on financing mechanisms targeted at <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnLT73416.html">adaptation for less-developed</a> countries.  Western countries will likely be less than enthusiastic about more development aid to the less developed world.  This is compounded by the lack of agreement on what constitutes legitimate "adaptation" aid and the difficulties in measuring its effective use.

Secondly, the issue of forests will be prominent during the talks.  There is a recognition that deforestation is a <a href="http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/008200811281902.htm">major contributor</a> to climate change and that reforestation can help sequester carbon.  The problem is assuring compliance with forestation schemes, developing the proper financial incentives for preserving forests, and taking into account the challenging issue of rural poverty that contributes to deforestation.

Thirdly, the positions of China and India will be under scrutiny.  They will certainly be <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Developmental_Issues/China_India_lead_demand_extra_help_for_climate_stuggle/articleshow/3758313.cms">advocates for large payouts for adaptation and mitigation</a>, but their willingness to commit to their own reductions (and such reductions should be binding) could influence the pressure put on the US and Canada

Finally, it will be interesting to see how much global financial uncertainty is invoked by Western countries to resist serious emissions targets.  Recent debates in Europe suggest there is a range of opinion within the European Union regarding meeting their long-stated reduction targets.  The US delegation will also be interesting to watch.  Although the <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2008/nov/112391.htm">official delegation</a> will be headed by Paula Dobriansky, Obama allies will be attending, including <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2231412/kerry-seeks-downplay">Senators John Kerry</a> and Amy Klobuchar.  While Kerry is not officially representing Obama, he will be a key voice in ratifying a post-Kyoto treaty as the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  How the EU, US, and Kerry delegations speak of the balance between emissions reductions and global economic uncertainty will be interesting to follow.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Not much happens on the first day of these negotiations; but it is interesting to see where the various players stake their ground in preparation for the impending discussions.

It was a bit amusing to <a href="http://copportal1.man.poznan.pl/Archive.aspx?EventID=109&Lang=floor">see the performance of lead US representative</a>, Harlan Watson, who is clearly phoning it in, well aware that the outgoing administration's presence is of little interest to the international community.  Nevertheless, there were some useful tidbits from his press conference:

- He "doubts there will be consensus" on emissions targets stemming from the Poznan talks.

-  When asked if the US delegation was working with Obama's transition team, Watson evaded the question and ultimately declined to commit to working with the transition.

-  When asked what positive contributions to international discussions the US has offered over the course of the Bush years, Watson pointed to Bush's convening of the leaders of the "major economies" last year--a move which many in the international community thought was a cynical bypassing of UN discussions.

From <a href="http://copportal1.man.poznan.pl/Archive.aspx?EventID=106&Lang=english">the European Union</a>, French delegate Brice Lalonde tried to be diplomatic when asked how the EU will deal with negotiations during the US leadership interregnum, but admitted that they were "lacking an important negotiation team."  He did acknowledge the Congressional delegation that will be led by John Kerry suggesting that there will likely be some behind the scenes interactions.

German environment minister, Sigmar Gabriel, was a bit more direct <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&sid=awkQ1B3ARcSE&refer=germany">when he suggested</a> that "many countries will hold back from making commitments" on binding emission reduction targets.

In addition to the official negotiations, the Poznan conference is marked by the presence of academics and civil society  groups who use the international attention to release research and reports on climate policy.  Given the fact that forestation/deforestation is going to be high on the agenda, a group of  conservation biologists <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSTRE4B04CA20081201">released a study warning</a> that forests will suffer under policies that promote biofuels.

This is important because in the successor to Kyoto there will be pressure to expand projects whereby developed countries can purchase carbon offsets by financing projects in the developing world.  Already the amount of Western money pouring into some Asian countries to develop palm oil plantations--<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/nov/25/friends-earth-forests">which could be defined as reforestation </a>--is causing <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/forests/3534204/Palm-oil-round-table-a-farce.html">ecological problems</a>.  Having a realistic view of biofuels will be important for developing effective policy.]]></content:encoded>

What's going on the Poland climate talks? Talk, and hopefully, some action!

by Dan Bloom

As the the COP14 climate talks got
underway this week in Poznan, Poland -- in anticipation of next year's
pivotal 2009 meeting in Copenhagen -- some 9,000 people at the climate
confab sat, listened, napped, strolled around, noshed on sandwiches,
twittered, emailed, iPodded and got ready to give it all their best
shot. Much is riding on these climate talks, and much is expected.
Will COP14 deliver the goods? Wait for the summary talks on December
12.

Meanwhile, RushPRnews spoke with an American professor from DePaul
University who is monitoring the meeting via a UN website, Hugh
Bartling, and this is what he told us: "Not much happened on the first
day of these negotiations," Bartling told us via his blog. "But it was
interesting to see where the various players staked their ground in
preparation for the impending discussions."

Professor Bartling, who teaches courses in public policy, political
theory and globalization at DePaul in snow-covered Chicago, noted: "It
was a bit amusing to see the performance of lead U.S. representative,
Harlan Watson, who is clearly phoning it in, well aware that the
outgoing Bush administration's presence is of little interest to the
international community. Nevertheless, there were a useful tidbit from
Watson's press conference: He ''doubts there will be consensus''  on
emissions targets stemming from the Poznan talks."

"The conference will last two weeks, with high-level ministerial
meetings taking place around December 11," Bartling told us. "The UN
has a nice website that offers live streaming media of many of the
deliberations -- including press conferences from the various official
delegations and civil society groups, as well as a twitter feed."

Bartling told RushPRnews that he would be following certain elements
closely and offering daily posts on his blog as he did last year
during the Bali talks.

"From the European Union, French delegate Brice Lalonde tried to be
diplomatic when asked how the EU will deal with negotiations during
the US leadership interregnum, but admitted that they were 'lacking an
important negotiation team'," Bartling added. "He did acknowledge the
US Congressional delegation that will be led by Senator John Kerry
suggesting that there will likely be some behind the scenes
interactions."

German environment minister, Sigmar Gabriel, was more direct when he
suggested that ''many countries will hold back from making

"In addition to the official negotiations, the Poznan conference is

"This is important because in the successor to Kyoto there will be

carbon offsets by financing projects in the developing world,"
Bartling noted, adding: "Already the amount of Western money pouring
into some Asian countries to develop palm oil plantations -- which
could be defined as reforestation  -- is causing ecological problems.
Having a realistic view of biofuels will be important for developing
effective policy."

is going to be high on the agenda, a group of conservation biologists
released a study warning that forests will suffer under policies that
promote biofuels.”

“This is important because in the successor to Kyoto there will be
pressure to expand projects whereby developed countries can purchase
carbon offsets by financing projects in the developing world,”
Bartling noted, adding: “Already the amount of Western money pouring
into some Asian countries to develop palm oil plantations — which
could be defined as reforestation — is causing ecological problems.
Having a realistic view of biofuels will be important for developing
effective policy.”

Dr Bartling will be blogging daily about the ongoing COP14 meetings at

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Formal discussions began in earnest today in Poznan.  There are numerous concurrent sessions taking place, but the one that is of special interest is the <a href="http://unfccc.int/documentation/documents/advanced_search/items/3594.php?such=j&meeting=%22(AWGLCA),+fourth+session%22&sorted=agenda#beg">Ad-hoc Working Group on Long-Term Cooperative Action</a> (AWG-LCA 4).  This is the group that put together <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2008/awglca4/eng/16.pdf">an 84-page document </a>[.pdf] over the past year that  is serving as the basis of a "shared vision" for the eventual post-Kyoto treaty.  Basically that document is a compilation of ideas presented by individual countries and international organizations--many of which are contradictory or, perhaps, incompatible.  The negotiations in Poznan are meant to begin the path towards resolving these contradictions.

Today there were at least three presentations at the AWG-LCA session worth noting: Japan, the European Union, and China.  Each gave its vision for shared emission targets.  Click on the graphics for .pdf versions of their presentations.
Japan offered the low ball: a 50% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from today's levels by 2050.

<a href="http://copportal1.man.poznan.pl/Doc.ashx?Id=45&Mime=application/pdf&Presentation=True"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/STV0fG1_z_I/AAAAAAAACw0/oLEr9W3sYuo/s400/JapanPoznan.JPG" /></a>

The European Union offered a 30% reduction from 1990 levels by 2020 and an 85% reduction from 1990 levels by 2050.

<a href="http://copportal1.man.poznan.pl/Doc.ashx?Id=44&Mime=application/pdf&Presentation=True"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/STV0e_P3cRI/AAAAAAAACws/qKeSguaHhNw/s400/EUPoznan.JPG" /></a>

China focused on equity, pointing out that 75% of the accumulated GHG emissions have come from 20% of the world's population.  They did not offer a specific long-term (2050) reduction target, but endorsed a 20-40% reduction from 1990 levels by 2020 as a mid-term target.

<a href="http://copportal1.man.poznan.pl/Doc.ashx?Id=43&Mime=application/pdf&Presentation=True"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/STV3ER7ETnI/AAAAAAAACw8/cPVGjiOHOhE/s400/china.JPG" /></a>

As a point of comparison, Obama has said that he wants the US to reduce its GHG emissions 12.8% from current levels by 2020, which would bring the country to its 1990 mark.   For the long-term (2050) he wants 80% reduction from 1990 levels.

In other developments, the Climate Action Network held a <a href="http://copportal1.man.poznan.pl/Archive.aspx?EventID=113&Lang=english">press conference</a> pushing delegates for action and <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i0Dpd-PeICHu4LSY5D9sVUkKo66wD94QLTDG1">chiding major emitters</a>, like the US, for a lack of urgency.

Also of interest, in a nod to Obama's nominee for Secretary of State, the French negotiator Brice Lalonde remarked on two different <a href="http://copportal1.man.poznan.pl/Archive.aspx?EventID=114&Lang=english">occasions</a> that former US President Bill Clinton said in the 1990s that he "loves Kyoto," suggesting that the new Obama/Clinton team might revive the former President's enthusiasm.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first news to report doesn't come from Poznan, but rather from Washington.  Today the US Department of Energy released its <a href="ftp://ftp.eia.doe.gov/pub/oiaf/1605/cdrom/pdf/ggrpt/057307.pdf">report [.pdf]</a> on the US GHG emissions from 2007 which indicates that emissions grew by 1.4% over the last year.  This has implications for Obama's commitment from last month to reduce emissions to 1990 levels. It would now require a 16.7% reduction--up from 15%.

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/_UjItqINMuSlpAvLKM2s2g"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/STcSCrMMHvI/AAAAAAAACxo/TflvXy9Jvbw/s400/GHGEmissions.JPG" /></a>

I haven't read the entire report, but I was surprised by the increase.  The report cited unfavorable weather conditions and a drop in hydropower capacity as factors leading to the increase.  It is too early to tell, but I would assume that we would see the 2008 figures be lower than 2007 due to the intensity of the economic downturn and the high prices of fuel for most of the year which pushed vehicle miles traveled downward.  On this note, there was an article from the <a href="http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto120220081456165682">Financial Times</a> today noting electricity demand dropped in Italy over the last two months by 30%.  Look for this to translate into GHG emissions reduction from <a href="http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_profile_of_Italy#Conventional_Thermal">a country that depends on fossil sources</a> for the bulk of its electricity generation.
On to Poznan.  The theme early on from a roundtable of activists <a href="http://copportal1.man.poznan.pl/Archive.aspx?EventID=119&Lang=floor">convened by the Climate Action Network </a>is that the situation is dire.  Steven Singer of the World Wildlife Fund says "we have seen nothing" from most major emitters for mitigation. He would like to see unconditional statement that developing countries have the obligation to take the lead on mitigation.

Saleemul Huq of the <a href="http://www.iied.org/climate-change/staff/saleem-huq">International Institute for Environment and Development</a> reminds us that the problem with global warming is not only because of current emissions, but due to cumulative emissions.  This is a common argument set forth by many less developed nations and is one that is rarely emphasized in the US press.  The legacy of Western prosperity is literally causing harm to innocent people in many parts of the world.

On this point of global equity, I want to point to an interesting report <a href="http://copportal1.man.poznan.pl/Archive.aspx?EventID=111&Lang=english">presented by Oxfam</a> yesterday.  <a href="http://www.oxfam.org/en/policy/bp123-turning-carbon-gold">"Turning Carbon Into Gold"</a> offers a blueprint for linking greenhouse gas mitigation with a way to raise the funds needed by less developed countries to adapt to climate change.

Assuming that the post-Kyoto agreement will have some type of cap-and-trade system, they estimate that $50 billion dollars could be raised by auctioning 7.5% of the emissions allowances.  Under Kyoto there are binding reduction targets, but only in the European Union is there a cap-and-trade scheme.  That scheme began with free distribution of allowances and has been moving lately into auctioning proportions.

The Oxfam proposal makes perfect sense--but it will likely meet resistance from many quarters.  I <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=251">posted </a>a couple of weeks ago about the problem of governments using these new revenues for general budgeting.  If governments see the auctioning of permits as a cash cow, they may be reluctant to earmark money for adaptation in the Global South.  Furthermore, plans like Obama's are counting on the money to fund domestic "green job" investments.  Needless to say industry is generally unenthusiastic about having to buy emissions permits, preferring to argue that compliance with emissions requirements will be too big of an economic burden.

The details for funding adaptation in the post-Kyoto agreement will not likely be agreed upon in Poznan; but the issue will be one to watch as negotiations on specifics commence after the new year.]]></content:encoded>

December 3, 2008

by Dan Bloom .....in Taiwan !

The two week meeting of 190 nations coming together to discuss the fate of the Earth, and the future survival of the human species, got underway on Monday and continues through December 12. According to two American bloggers, one on the ground in Poznan, attending the meeting as an observer/activist, and the other a professor monitoring the talks from afar, things are heating up.

“Formal discussions began in earnest [on the second day of the current climate talks] in Poznan,” RushPRnews learned from reading the Poznan blog of Professor Hugh Bartling at the DePaul University in Chicago.

“There are numerous concurrent sessions taking place, but the one that is of special interest is the Ad-hoc Working Group on Long-Term Cooperative Action. This is the group that put together an 84-page document over the past year that is serving as the basis of a ’shared vision’ for the eventual post-Kyoto treaty. Basically that document is a compilation of ideas presented by individual countries and international organizations — many of which are contradictory or, perhaps, incompatible. The negotiations in Poznan are meant to begin the path towards resolving these contradictions.”

Bartling added: “Today there were at least three presentations at the AWG-LCA session worth noting: Japan, the European Union, and China.

Each gave its vision for shared emission targets.”

“In other developments,” Bartling said, “the Climate Action Network held a press conference pushing delegates for action and chiding major emitters, like the US, for a lack of urgency. Also of interest, in a nod to Obama’s nominee for Secretary of State [Hillary Clinton], the French negotiator remarked on two different occasions that former U.S. President Bill Clinton said in the 1990s that he ‘loves Kyoto,’suggesting that the new Obama/Clinton team might revive the former U.S. President’s enthusiasm.”

Keith Johnson, writing in a blog on the Wall Street Journal wesbite, uses a bit of humor to paint a picture of what is happening this week in Poland, noting: “A year ago, gaggles of climate negotiators at least could enjoy the weather in Bali. This December, the same crowd is huddled in the Polish winter as international climate negotiations come to Poznan, Poland. Much like Bali, though, Poznan resembles a Mexican standoff more than anything else.”

The Mexican standoff Johnson refers to? “Rich countries aren’t ready to commit to specific targets for greenhouse-gas reductions by 2020.

The U.S. is in limbo, caught between an outgoing administration lukewarm about tackling climate change and a gung-ho incoming administration that can’t do anything about it until next year at the earliest. Developing countries are sticking to their guns and demanding richer countries take the earliest and biggest steps to curb emissions.”

Johnson’s conclusion? “Analysts are scrambling to dampen already low expectations, warning that the two-week long Polish summit won’t likely resolve any of the thorny issues standing in the way of drafting a successor to the Kyoto Protocol.”

Meanwhile, climate activists and protest groups have been making their presence felt at the climate talks, too, trying to create eye-catching photo opps for the international wire services to beam back to readers on all seven continents.

In fact, several green groups have been upping the pressure on delegates and world leaders with wacky stunts aimed at prodding them to get moving on tackling the very divisive issue of global warming.

For example, the World Wildlife Fundwelcomed participants at the 12-day talksby handing out walnuts and urging them to “crack the climate nut” and overcome the negotiations deadlock.

In another protest, Greenpeace unveiled a sculpture depicting the Earth on the brink of destruction from a “tidal wave” of carbon dioxide made of wood and coal.

Joshua Kahn Russell, a young twentysomething Brandeis graduate who on the ground in Poznan this week, told RushPRnews that “the activist and NGO community is buzzing with ideas about how to make the most of these sessions to come out with a strong path toward the increasingly looming deadlines next year in Copenhagen. One of our concerns is that the delegates are trying to lower expectations for this process, telling the press (and each other) that it’s okay not to expect too much from the Poland talks. But across the world, we all know that we can’t wait anymore.”

Russell quoted a Danish climate activist who said: “The clock is ticking and time has run out. It is now we have to face the consequences of our over-consumption in the West.”

Yes, the clock is ticking. Tick, tick, tock.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>US Climate Neogtiator Plans to do Nothing at Poznan</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Under Secretary of State Paula Dobriansky will be arriving in Poznan next week for the high-level ministerial negotiations that will be the culmination of the two-week UN process towards a post-Kyoto global climate change treaty.  She and the chief White House environmental policy advisor, James Connaughton <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081203-7.html">had a press briefing today</a> in advance of their trip.

Dobriansky basically said that their participation in efforts to achieve anything substantial will be minimal:
<blockquote>In Poznan, our highest priority will be to set the stage for an effective outcome in 2009.  And what this means specifically is that we hope that Poznan can produce a deeper understanding of parties' priorities and expectations, and then also our objective there is to reach consensus on a practical work plan -- a work plan that will guide us and the new team into intensive negotiations into the spring period of next year for agreement at Copenhagen in December in 2009.</blockquote>
This, of course, is essentially a replay from last year's meeting in Bali.  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/12/20071205-9.html">Nearly a year ago</a>, Dobriansky explained what the US delegation wanted to accomplish in Bali:
<blockquote>First, we would like to see a successful outcome in Bali, and specifically, the United States is very committed to developing a new global post-2012 framework that is environmentally effective and economically sustainable.  And toward this end, the United States will be working with its partners to reach consensus on a Bali road map that will advance negotiations</blockquote>
Over the past year we've moved from wanting to "advance negotiations" to an outcome that will "produce a deeper understanding of parties' priorities"!

On the one hand, this inaction is possibly a good thing--having the Bush Administration lock the US into some position that would likely be ineffective and possibly damaging would not be beneficial in the long run.

On the other hand, the interregnum in US power is giving other countries--namely <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/world/south-africa-slams-rich-australia-over-greenhouse-target-delay-20081203-6pxq.html">Australia</a>, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&sid=a4XWNYhNWEQw&refer=japan">Japan</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.greenpeace.ca/2008/12/02/prentice-in-poznan-just-stay-away%E2%80%A6/">Canada</a>--a convenient decoy to allow them to dodge their own commitments.  The void, in turn, could make it difficult to have a Kyoto successor in place by next December.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Day Four at the UN-sponsored climate change talks saw activists getting more vocal and the various parties fortifying their negotiating positions.

<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3118/3082076328_2d12683cc2_m.jpg" />

On the latter theme, activists from Greenpeace climbed down from a coal-belching smokestack in order to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gVN94ZFazFv-2dFwSqNBr6opBXAw">set up a protest camp</a> at the talks and publicized its report on shifting the global energy regime to renewable sources.

A <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hI_wsEfalT3owc8_fiKOhjaPPOhQD94S1B000">Swiss activist rolled into Poznan</a> on a <a href="http://www.solartaxi.com/blog/2008/12/03/poznan1/">solar-powered taxi</a> after driving 50,000 miles around the world.  UN climate change chief, Yvo de Boer got to ride the last kilometer with Louis Palmer, the activist.

On the negotiation front, <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-12/04/content_10458019.htm">more discussion was held on how to finance</a> an adaptation fund that will provide less developed countries financing to address climate change-induced policy problems.  An adaptation fund was initially set up under the Kyoto Protocol and has been financed by a 2% levy placed on offset projects financed by industrialized countries to meet their Kyoto emissions targets.

The problem with the adaptation fund is that it hasn't raised enough revenue.

There was also controversy regarding the expansion of offset project schemes.  Many activists are skeptical of these schemes called in UN jargon, Clean Development Mechanisms.  The worry is that too liberal of a CDM scheme will likely result in industrialized countries choosing not to mitigate their own emissions and opt out for purchasing credits in the less developed world.  Today <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL4383081.html">Brazil rejected the idea</a> of using CDMs in their country for forestry protection thinking that it would negatively impact their control over their own land.

On mitigation, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&sid=au859ktp.6Sk&refer=latin_america">China amped up the rhetoric</a> against the United States with China saying that President-elect Obama's plan to reduce US emissions to 1990 levels is not "ambitious enough."

Finally, <a href="http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2008/12/05/indigenous-groups-want-their-voices-heard-in-poznan">groups representing indigenous peoples</a> are seeking some mechanism for participating in the talks.  Indigenous communities are often not adequately represented by their national governments and often directly bear the initial brunt of climate problems.  UN climate change chief, Yvo de Boer met with indigenous representatives today and expressed sympathy for their cause.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Korean Company&#039;s Madagascar Land Grab Up In the Air</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month I <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=253">posted</a> about a supposed deal hatched by the Korean conglomerate, Daewoo to lease half of the arable land in Madagascar for export farming.  Not surprisingly, <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/11/23/madagascar-south-korean-land-deal-sparks-controversy/">charges of neo-colonialism ensued</a> given the fact that Madagascar has high levels of food insecurity and a rather fragile ecology.

The details of the agreement have been difficult to ascertain.  However, <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c899cd3c-c25b-11dd-a350-000077b07658.html">today's Financial Times reports</a> that the deal hasn't been finalized and that any contract would be contingent on an environmental assessment and be approved by the country's cabinet.

It is still unclear what to make of this latest report, however.  The article cites a statement attributed to Daewoo <a href="http://www.madagascar-presidency.gov.mg/index.php/view/outputs/item/1193">posted on the website</a> of Madagascar's president, Marc Ravalomanana, but the company apparently wouldn't confirm that they had actually released the statement.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today and tomorrow mark the end of the first week of UN-sponsored talks for a post-Kyoto climate change deal.  These are the days where mid-level negotiators are hashing through proposals in an attempt to develop a document that high-level ministers can agree upon when they arrive in Poznan next week.  The informal meetings are closed to the press, making it hard to get solid information about the negotiations.

The news in Poland today is actually three hundred kilometers to the north where French President Nicholas Sarkozy is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/feedarticle/8118469">set to meet tomorrow in Gdansk</a> with eastern EU members to agree on a European-wide law that will reduce emissions and increase the profile of renewable energy in the EU.

The EU process is tangentially related to what is going on in Poznan to the extent that the EU's reputation as a global leader on climate change policy could have a significant impact on the tone of negotiations.  Simply put: if the EU waters down its goals it gives incentives for other industrialized countries to do likewise.

The EU law is more concerned with the medium term, with the figure of  20% reduction in GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2020 as its target.  The figure would increase to 30% if other non-EU industrialized countries joined in on a strong mid-term target.

While the targets are safe, the current controversy relates to implementation, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122843632523081319.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">with the current financial crisis casting a shadow</a> that encourages heavy carbon countries (like Poland and Italy) to push deferring action.  At issue, for instance, is the timeline for introducing full auctioning of emissions credits under the cap-and-trade scheme.  During the first iteration of cap-and-trade many of the credits were distributed without charge.  The new law would phase in auctioning--the revenues from which could be used to finance the switch to low-carbon energy sources.

Also controversial is the plan to create obligations for new sectors under the scheme--particularly aviation and shipping.  The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7765094.stm">BBC has a good rundown</a> of the EU package.  Poland has recently threatened to veto the package, but with Sarkozy's diplomacy and the fact that 10,000 people from throughout the world are in Poland for the UN conference, it would be remarkable if the Poles actually followed through on their threat.

But if Sarkozy can get the recalcitrant countries solidly on board with a strong emissions reduction plan this weekend, it could provide momentum for the final week of talks in Poznan.]]></content:encoded>

Here in Taiwan, for example, the two English papers daily, no story at all all week about Poznan. Nada, nothing. Not one word. Today, finally, one paper did run a story. Five days late...... see this story below for more...

DOT EARTH blog at NYTImes today asks a good question:

Is The News Coverage of Climate Change Entering ‘A Trance’?

By Andrew C. Revkin

I recently asked whether the world is poised to enter an Obama-style “trance” on climate policy given the focus on economic turmoil and plunge in oil prices, which have in the past seemed synchronized with concerns about transforming energy policy. (Keep in mind that the chief executive officer of Gulf Oil said Wednesday that oil could drop to $20 a barrel and gasoline $1 a gallon).



Coverage of global warming, 2004 to 2008. Click on the image for a full-size graphic. (Credit: Maxwell Boykoff, Oxford University)Now Maxwell Boykoff, who studies the media and climate change at Oxford University, has come up with an initial snapshot looking at climate stories over the last four years in 50 newspapers in 20 countries and (along with a colleague, Maria Mansfield) finds that the media may be entering a climate trance (or ending a bubble, depending on your view).

He’s presented these data (click on graph at right) in a side event at the Poznan, Poland, climate conference, where the main event — the high-level sessions — begin early next week. What’s your take on this graph?

In an e-mail, Dr. Boykoff said: “Apart from that Oceania blip in mid-2008, it does seem like stagnation or decreasing coverage. I’m curious about links between that and possible interpretations by negotiators of decreased public pressure to put forward a strong agreement leading into Copenhagen.”

Of course, the burst of coverage in 2007, surrounding the release of the fourth report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, could be seen as the journalistic equivalent of the global heat wave in 1998, propelled by a Pacific Ocean El Nino warming — creating a peak that distorts a trend. So the long-term trend may still be up.

To set the recent trend in broader context, check out sociologist Robert Brulle’s graph tracking network news coverage of global warming and the following graph of newspaper coverage of climate change from 1980 to 2006 (a separate newspaper sample) from Dr. Boykoff’s recent paper in Nature Reports - Climate Change:]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Not much news from Poznan today.  Like yesterday, mid-level negotiators are meeting privately in advance of the ministerial meetings next week.

Activists used this day to stage global demonstrations to raise awareness about the global climate crisis.  In <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gVKelVpUGnmz0qI0gEjfBdEZho2Q">London, 10,000 people turned up</a> for a demonstration at the Houses of Parliament, while a <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-12/07/content_10466923.htm">thousand young people marched in Poznan</a> itself.  Representatives from the <a href="http://www.modernghana.com/news/193744/1/global-day-of-action-on-climate-change-december-6t.html">Ghana National Youth Coalition on Climate Change explain</a> the demands of the youth movement, which include a strong mid-term target of a 40% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2020.

Meanwhile, Australian Climate Minister, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/12/07/2439873.htm?section=australia">Peggy Wong, told ABC1</a> that we should not expect specific emissions targets to be decided upon in Poznan.  The Rudd government had originally indicated that it would announce its domestic targets prior to Poznan, but pushed the announcement until after the conference.  Their unwillingness to announce targets--coupled with Wong's statements--will likely be seen as another blow for a serious agreement to come out of the talks.

Many NGOs and international organizations held side events today.  Of interest to me <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081205153515.htm">was the presentation</a> of an <a href="http://www.unep.org/pdf/carbon_biodiversity.pdf">atlas [.pdf--big file]</a> developed by the UN Environmental Programme that maps the confluence of carbon sinks and areas of high biodiversity.  With about 20% of greenhouse gas emissions coming from deforestation, the atlas is designed to visualize the potential in reducing emissions while simultaneously protecting biodiversity.

Given the discussion on this blog about the Korean agribusiness scheme in Madagascar, I thought it would be interesting to reproduce this map from the report.  The green signifies high biodiversity while the underlying layer of gray is the amount of carbon stored in the land's vegetation.  The darker the green, the more confluence of biodiversity and carbon. The atlas, then, would recommend these areas for greater protection.

		<title>Obama&#039;s Economic Stimulus Plan: Take One</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Barack Obama used his weekly <a href="http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/the_key_parts_of_the_jobs_plan/">web/radio address yesterday</a> to call for an economic stimulus plan that would entail "the single largest new investment in our national infrastructure since the creation of the federal highway system in the 1950s."

I haven't seen the actual plan, but his laundry list was promising: retrofit federal government buildings for maximum energy efficiency, build and remodel school buildings, and dedicate resources towards expanding broadband internet access throughout the country.

The only potentially troubling aspect was the equation of transportation infrastructure with "roads and bridges" and no mention of public transportation.  Given the numerous statements he's given on climate change, the emission of less carbon-intensive forms of mobility from his speech could have been the result of time constraints.

Regardless, this type of active spending will likely have tremendous economic benefits if implemented in a systematic fashion.  Ignoring the carbon impact of this spending, however, could negate benefits in the long-term if the country finds itself highly indebted and needing to adapt to climate variability.

Michael O'Hare of Berkeley <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/transition_20082009_/2008/12/fast_start_short_honeymoon.php">gives a compelling critique</a> of Obama's address over at the Reality Based Community.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Official negotiations did not take place today in deference to the Eid al-Adha holiday.  However, many delegations held press conferences and gave updates going in to the final week of negotiations.

On the <a href="http://copportal1.man.poznan.pl/Archive.aspx?EventID=146&Lang=floor">US side</a>, head negotiator Harlan Watson indicated that "progress is being made"  in negotiations; however when asked what has been accomplished, Watson admitted that there has been "no push from anybody to foreclose options."  In fact, he said that the <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2008/awglca4/eng/16.pdf">82-page working document  [.pdf]</a> that serves as the basis of discussions is actually being expanded!  Isn't the goal of negotiations to ultimately "foreclose options"?

On the <a href="http://copportal1.man.poznan.pl/Archive.aspx?EventID=145&Lang=floor">UNFCCC side</a>, climate chief Yvo de Boer said convergence is emerging on a "framework for adaptation", the establishment of regional centres to offer technical assistance as it pertains to adaptation, a <a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5955">possible insurance mechanism for states</a> to deal with the risk associated with climate change, and a special consideration of the particular issues that face of indigenous peoples.  He also seemed to contradict Harlan Watson on the 82-page working document saying that while more proposals had come in during the last few days of negotiation, there would be a "next-generation" version of the document which would be condensed and set the stage for the next year's negotiations.

On the <a href="http://copportal1.man.poznan.pl/Archive.aspx?EventID=182&Lang=floor">EU side</a>, chief negotiator (and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-03-30-kerry-france_x.htm">cousin of John Kerry</a>!), Brice Lalonde, was a little more optimistic.  He indicated that parties had agreed that the financial crisis can not be used as an excuse for inaction.  Any disagreements between parties are like "little stones in our shoes which we have to try to deal with on our way--they are not very big stones."  He also expected that the Obama administration will have engaged in "domestic negotiation" by next year's meeting in Copenhagen presumably so the US will be able to agree to specific emissions reductions.  It is unclear if "domestic negotiation" refers to passed legislation, but if the US can actually commit to a domestic 2050 target by next December that would certainly enhance the prospects for a post-Kyoto agreement to be signed on-time.

Meanwhile, here in Chicago, Al Gore is scheduled to meet tomorrow with Barack Obama.  The <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/12/08/obama_and_gore_to_talk_climate.html">Washington Post reports</a> that Gore is not expected to be in line for a job in the new administration but is consulting with Obama and Biden on climate change as the President-elect puts together his environmental policy team.  Funny--Gore hasn't mentioned the meeting yet on <a href="http://twitter.com/algore">his Twitter feed</a>.  However he did say that <a href="http://blog.algore.com/2008/12/next_week.html">he is going to Poznan</a> sometime this week.  Given that he is <a href="http://www.ukom.gov.si/eng/slovenia/publications/slovenia-news/7573/7620/">scheduled to make an appearance</a> in Ljubljana at a function sponsored by Diners Club Slovenija on Wednesday, he will probably get to Poznan as ministerial talks begin.   Is he going to function as an unofficial Obama emissary?  Will it make a difference to the outcome of negotiations?]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Progress has been slow at the international climate negotiations in Poland as the world works towards a new international agreement at the end of 2009.  This isn't a surprising outcome at this stage in negotiations.  Without the new US leadership in place and with many of the key pieces of the post-2012 international agreement likely only woven together in the "final deal" this was the anticipation as "no major breakthroughs were expected".

But, some emerging debates have arisen that will be central to the negotiations next year as the world leads-in to an international agreement in Copenhagen (Dec. 2009).  I discuss some of the key ones here: http://preview.tinyurl.com/5ablpf]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks, Jake, for the info.  It's good to hear from someone on the ground.  Your summary is interesting--especially as it pertains to the US.  From afar, there looks like relief from other countries that Obama is going to bring new blood to the negotiations--however, his mid-term (2020) reduction targets are pretty weak.  Has there been any critique of his specifics there?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just a brief post today--For non-US readers, we had a pretty dramatic political scandal here in my hometown today that has consumed too much of my attention.  It involves good old fashioned corruption from an extremely unpopular governor and President-Elect Obama's old Senate seat.

While the police were arresting and arraigning our governor, across the street from the courthouse, <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/12/obama-gore-1.html">Barack Obama met with Al Gore</a> before the latter's trip to Poznan.  The press was more interested in the emerging Illinois governor scandal than with climate change, but Obama did manage to declare that "the time for delay is over.  The time for denial is over."  Questions about his view on the UN's "shared vision," how to reform the Clean Development Mechanism, or how to finance a climate adaptation fund I guess will have to wait.

In Poznan itself, the official delegations continued to meet behind closed doors in an effort to hash out an agreement for ministers to sign later this week.  Tomorrow various working groups will be continuing their open meetings.  The one group that merits attention is the Ad-Hoc Working Group on Long-term Action Under the Convention (AWG-LCA).  They are the group responsible for setting the stage for debate on emissions reduction targets for the post-Kyoto agreement.

They just released the <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2008/awglca4/eng/crp06.pdf">summary [.pdf]</a> of the discussions thus far.  On the 2050 goal the document describes "many parties" arguing for a global 50% reduction from 1990 levels and "some parties" arguing for 80%.  Developed countries' obligations are seen as being between 80-95% of 1990 levels by 2050 and 25-40% of 1990 levels by 2020.  Obama's plan would meet an 80% reduction by 2050 but only a reduction TO 1990 levels by 2020 for the US.

One thing that UN climate chief Yvo de Boer thinks will come out of this week's talks is a financing mechanism for less developed countries to use for adaptation projects.   Many of the articles on the Poznan talks from the <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/12/10/climate-change-meeting-warms-nations-talk-money.html">Asian</a> and <a href="http://thecitizen.co.tz/newe.php?id=9200">African</a> press are preoccupied with how much money will be available in an adaptation fund.

In other developments, Oxfam tried to tap into the star power of Scarlett Johansson, Thome Yorke, Desmond Tutu, Anne Lennox, and others by releasing a <a href="http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/files/open_letter_to_world_leaders.pdf">letter [.pdf]</a> singed by the aforementioned (and others) urging delegates to commit to making sure that world leaders stop global temperature rise at 2C.

Finally, it appears that the EU ministers are beginning to show some agreement on their ambitious energy and climate plan that has the ability to significantly impact the UN talks in Poznan.  According to the Financial Times, diplomats worked out an agreement on a <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/76b140f4-c65c-11dd-a741-000077b07658.html">renewable energy portfolio </a>calling for an EU-wide figure of 20% renewable production by 2020.

Tomorrow, EU leaders are meeting in Brussels to come to an agreement on the entire package--including reduction targets for 2020.  This has occupied the attention of many activist groups throughout Europe, including the <a href="http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/climate_change/news/index.cfm?uNewsID=152361">World Wildlife Fund</a>,  and Plane Stupid, which <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/news/article5305860.ece">disrupted flights</a> at London's Stanstead Airport.]]></content:encoded>

The list they come up with is pretty sensible: reduce the federal transportation funding bias that favors highways, link environmental policy to neighborhood design, deploy bailout and stimulus dollars to smart growth projects and policies, shift tax policy to reduce the bias towards driving.

The list is little lean on specifics; but I would add one that might help: integrate carbon accounting in the budgeting and regulatory process.  This could probably be done through an executive order and be implemented through the Office of Management and Budget.  OMB reviews budget requests and program performance.  As such they have a tremendous impact on the regulations and the practice of policy implementation.

If carbon intensity were an evaluative criteria, there would be an incentive for energy-efficient practices coming out of the federal agencies that influence metropolitan regions the most, like HUD or DOT.  Carbon efficiency would compel states and cities to plan for higher densities and more walkable communities--the things new urbanists love.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Granholm as Energy Secretary?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm is scheduled to meet with Barack Obama's transition team today with a cadre of her energy advisers.  This has led to <a href="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081210/POLITICS01/812100378/1409/METRO">speculation</a> that she may be in line for a cabinet appointment as Energy Secretary.

I don't know much about Granholm--but it comes as a bit of surprise that she would emerge as energy secretary given Obama's penchant for choosing people with significant expertise for cabinet positions.  Given the prominence he as placed on climate change and renewables, it would make more sense to choose someone who has spent a lot of time dedicated to those issues.

This isn't meant to be a dig at Granholm, but her background as a lawyer is less apposite to the position than if she were, say, a scientist or climate change analyst/practitioner.  Someone like <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1997/chu-autobio.html">Steven Chu</a>--who has also been on the Energy Secretary shortlist--might make more sense.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the high-level minsters begin arriving in Poznan today for the end of the UN climate change talks, today was spent by the delegations to get an agreement on SOMETHING so the two weeks don't turn out to be a total wash.

At this point a wash looks difficult to avoid. Aside from the fact that the US has basically been a non-player at Poznan, the supposed leaders of the developed country block, the European Union, are still trying to get their own internal debates straightened out.  The European Union's Environmental Minister, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSLA67180520081210">Stavros Dimas, isn't worried</a>--he indicated that he is confident that the short-term emissions target of 20% below 1990 levels "will be intact."  The dispute is centered less on the reductions targets, and more on how coal-heavy countries, like Poland will pay for mitigation. It is looking like a deal will be hatched tomorrow that has Western European countries footing a part of the bill and a certain amount of emissions permits will be given to Eastern European industry (as opposed to being auctioned).

In Poznan, the negotiators charged with developing the details of the successor to Kyoto adopted their agenda for the next <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2008/awglca4/eng/l10.pdf">12 months [.pdf]</a>.   The group will be meeting again next June and will be taking input from parties up until the end of April for what they refer to as the "negotiating text."  This doesn't give Obama's team very long to get into the swing of things.

Although Bush's people have maintained a low profile, they did put forward <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2008/awglca4/eng/misc05a02p02.pdf">proposals (p.71, [.pdf])</a> for the 2009 talks.  These inputs will be part of the negotiations in the spring that lead up to the June meeting.

Namely, they insist that "at least some developing countries should be taking the same kinds of mitigation actions as developed countries."  This goes back to Bush's long-standing criticism of Kyoto as not requiring India and China to have any binding reductions.  China and India have a pretty legitimate response: per capita emissions in their countries are nothing near Western levels and the persistence of CO2s in the atmosphere is the the main source of the problem. Western countries emitted those persistent CO2s and they have the obligation to shoulder the burden of future reductions.

There were also some more promising elements suggested by the US delegation.  They called for "creating legal and regulatory conditions that facilitate adaptation (for example, building codes, land use planning, and strengthening policy coherence among sectors)."  This is interesting from the US perspective since--as it stands now--the federal government doesn't have much control over land use decisions.  There is nothing prohibiting the feds constitutionally, however, from demanding carbon efficiency in local projects that it funds.  So, advocates for policies that encourage mixed-use zoning, or high density development would be well-served by this type of proposal.

It is important to stress that this is a very preliminary document and much will change throughout the next twelve months.  It would be interesting to see an enterprising reporter, however, ask Obama about his stand on whether he would only agree to binding emissions reductions if China and India did likewise.  It is especially apposite since <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&sid=au859ktp.6Sk&refer=latin_america">India and China are already turning up the heat</a> on Obama saying his proposals don't go far enough.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It appears that speculation about Obama's pick of Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm as energy secretary was misguided.

Both the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/10/AR2008121003681.html?hpid=topnews">Washington Post</a> and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSTRE4BA00O20081211">Reuters</a> are reporting that Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Chu is Obama's pick for Energy Secretary.  Chu has been the head of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, has a keen understanding of the climate change challenge, and has overseen research into renewable energy.  This is a great pick and gives credence to Obama's push to tackle climate change and situate the US at the center of technological innovation in the energy sector.

Numerous outlets are also pointing out that former EPA chief, Carol Browner, will be a White House-based climate change czar.  Browner is good on the issue, but it is unclear how she will be able to manage the portfolio given the fact that policies relating to the climate span numerous bureaucracies and agencies.  If she has the ear of the President--and other cabinet secretaries recognize that--she could be very effective.

At the EPA he is apparently set to nominate Lisa Jackson as the top administrator.  I don't know much about Jackson, but her <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hiipg0FXPAt7yADz4OktINGrXgagD95071D80">pedigree as a chemical engineer</a> and 16-year veteran at the agency suggest she will bring professionalism and a scientific background to an agency that has been woefully politicized under Bush.

Finally, the head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality is <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/12/10/sutley_to_chair_council_on_env.html">supposed to be Deputy Mayor of Los Angeles, Nancy Sutley</a>.  This is a key position because the CEQ head is generally the top Presidential adviser on environmental issues.  Sutley was a top aide to Browner at the EPA, so perhaps that means we can expect much-needed cooperation on the climate change portfolio.  I also am impressed that Sutley comes with an urban background.  Hopefully this will result in a richer understanding of the need for sustainable cities to be at the top of the federal environmental agenda.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[High level ministers, ambassadors, and heads of state arrived in Poznan today for the last two days of negotiations.  Thus the meeting was dominated by a ministerial meeting featuring short speeches by the high-level delegates.  There were nice bits of political theater, but very little in the way of substance.

Among the more forceful speeches were those from less developed countries who were quite harsh on the EU's lack of action.  <a href="http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/topstories.aspx?ID=BD4A903994">South African representative </a><font class="storycopy"><font class="storyblurb"><a href="http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/topstories.aspx?ID=BD4A903994">Marthinus van Schalkwyk</a>, for example, chided developed countries for failing to even talk about plans floated by less developed countries whereby they would lower emissions with adequate aid from the industrialized world.</font>

Australia <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2008/s2443314.htm">was also called</a> out for their failure to express firm support for binding emissions in the post-Kyoto agreement--a position more in line with that of the Bush Administration.  <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24783756-5013871,00.html">The Australian is reporting</a> that the PM Kevin Rudd is being lobbied heavily by Gordon Brown and Al Gore to reverse course.

Some developing countries even announced their own plans for domestic cuts.  <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jSOyxGS0hqCqTYFTmhJ47G-ijrOwD950NUO00">Mexico's plan is the boldest.</a>  Their target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% from 2002 levels.  This apparently will be done--in part--by instituting a domestic cap-and-trade scheme.

Finally, there was significant dispute over the role of forest protection and deforestation in stemming the climate crisis.  The issue is admittedly quite complex.  Measurement of carbon in forest ecosystems is a task in and of itself.  Part of any deal would involve developed countries funding forest enhancement projects in the less developed world in exchange for credits to be applied to their emissions reduction targets.  Therefore, how one goes about measuring the carbon offsets in these types of projects is quite important.

<a href="http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2008/12/12/draft-resolution-on-redd-sails-through-to-copenhagen-">Forests are going to be on the table</a>, but look for intense debate next year at the Copenhagen talks. I found one interesting tidbit in an article in the Indian paper, The Hindu.  <a href="http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200812121022.htm">It discusses</a> how the mention of the rights to indigenous peoples in the negotiating document on forest issues was deliberately watered down by the US.

On Friday there will be more speeches--including one by the high-level US representative, Paula Dobriansky. Today the delegation held a news conference which was amusing.  Fiona Harvey (I think) of the Financial Times asked Dobriansky and Bush's top environmental adviser James Connaughton if they had any "regrets" over their handling of the climate change issue over the past 8 years.

<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/12/10/dobriansky-climate-change/">Think Progress</a> jumped on the silliness of Dobrinasky's regret that they could have done better at "public diplomacy."  Connaugthon, however, internalized the Bush administration's incapacity for self reflection in saying that his biggest regret was that it took Russia too long to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and that Russian indecision made it too hard to get on with mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.

That is true--however, the Bush administration could have solved that problem simply by working to ratify the protocol itself!  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1248278.stm">Bush, of course, walked away from Kyoto</a> in his third month as President.  A US ratification would have made the treaty binding at a much earlier date.</font>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Poznan Climate Change Talks: Final Day</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The UN-sponsored climate change talks ended today in Poznan with little fanfare.  High-level delegates continued their speeches, but agreements on anything of substance were minimal.

If you've read previous posts in <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?cat=15">this series</a>, the reasons for this will not be surprising.  The interregnum of US leadership proved to be both a force for generating excitement amongst the delegates and an excuse for delaying action.

Europeans found it hard to hide their elation about the new US leadership while cynical delegates from countries <a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/552592">like Canada used the vacuum to water down</a> their own positions.  Perhaps the European elation was, itself, a tactic to avoid drawing attention to their own internal dysfunction that has marked the last two weeks.

Meanwhile, countries in the less developed world articulated their sense of urgency regarding the immediate effects of climate change quite passionately but, ultimately, to little end.  An "adaptation fund" was agreed upon, but <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL6349998.html">its financing mechanisms have still not been resolved</a>.  Currently, it is largely capitalized by a levy placed on projects undertaken in the less developed world, but funded by developed countries to meet a portion of their emissions targets.  It has only raised about $80 million; however, the UN estimates that developing countries need $86 billion per year to fund their adaptation needs.   To meet the funding shortfall <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/12/13/europe/EU-Poland-Climate-Talks.php">developing countries were advocating</a> for a financing scheme which would tax transactions on the carbon trading market.  This suggestion, however, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gaEYka38_0d_VzPkPCqK2vE_X68A">was rejected</a> by developed countries

So where do we go from here?  Last year's meeting in Bali set next December as the date to have the successor to the Kyoto Protocol fully negotiated.  By April 2009 countries will submit more detailed language which will then be consolidated into a "negotiation document" to be discussed at a meeting in Bonn in June.

As I see it there will be three main issues to look at in the next seven months. The first will be the aggressiveness of the US in the negotiations.  As mentioned above, delegates from all over the world expressed excitement about the new administration.  I don't doubt that some of this is genuine--but a lot of the good will to the US was likely due to the fact that they were not a serious negotiating partner in Poznan.

While Obama was nearly universally praised, there was little criticism of the fact that he has already announced midterm GHG emissions targets that are quite low.  He is, however, in line with the EU on long-term goals.

The problem with Obama's position is that the scientific assessments of the IPCC (which provide the basis for the talks) say that more dramatic short-term action is important in keeping global temperature growth below the 2C range.  Will Obama be able to get a "pass" for the weak US short-term position?

Secondly, the issue of financing adaptation will be a serious sticking point that probably won't get resolved until Copenhagen (if then).  Developing countries--and many <a href="http://forum.europarl.europa.eu/jiveforums/servlet/JiveServlet/download/20-455-773-225/WWF%20GW%20EP%20Financing%20adaptation%20to%20climate%20change.pdf">NGOs [.pdf]</a>--argue that it could be relatively easy to raise the requisite adaptation funds by taxing the carbon market.  The problem is that in the developed countries, there is not only a strong push from industry to be given emission credits for free, but there are domestic demands for the money.  Obama's cap-and-trade scheme, for instance, calls for using a significant proportion of the money earned by auctioning credits for a "green jobs" initiative.  How can competing claims on the carbon market auction money be reconciled?

Finally, the issue of forests--or to use UN parlance, reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation [REDD]--will be another North/South battle without prospects for easy resolution.  At issue is finding an appropriate financial mechanism to give developing countries an incentive not to deforest. Additionally, there is a concern amongst indigenous peoples that any forest plan involving large sums of capital could <a href="http://www.survival-international.org/news/4035">violate the rights of indigenous peoples</a>.

That's where we stand. It will certainly be an exciting few months on this front as Obama gets rolling.  This will be he first--and in many respects, most difficult--foreign policy challenge for the new administration.  Let's see how they respond.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Obama Names New Housing Secretary</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[President-Elect Barack Obama announced New York City housing chief, Shaun Donovan, as his choice for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

Donovan has an extensive background in affordable housing issues, including a stint as a Deputy Assistant Secretary at HUD during the Clinton years, overseeing multifamily housing policy.

It appears that he has a reputation for being pragmatic and open to innovative housing policies.  He has been a proponent of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/23/realestate/23cov.html">inclusionary zoning</a>--a scheme whereby builders get to build at a higher density if they dedicate a small percentage of units to affordable housing. The effect is to soften the burden of high housing costs to working families in hot real estate markets.

He has also <a href="http://www.metropolismag.com/cda/story.php?artid=3536">encouraged architectural innovation and quality design</a> in public housing construction in New York--perhaps stemming from his architectural training.

He does come to the job with some potentially controversial opinions.  He has been an advocate for lowering the cap on the tax subsidies given to home owners who deduct their local property tax and mortgage interest.  As it stands, deductions up to a million dollars can be taken.  <a href="http://www.housingfinance.com/ahf/articles/2008/mar/SHAPEFUTURE0308.htm">It has been reported</a> that Donovan argues that by lowering the subsidy excess funds could be used for affordable housing projects.

Calls for reducing or eliminating the deduction for mortgage interest and property taxes have been heard for a long time.  Most recently the call came from <a href="http://www.taxreformpanel.gov/">Bush's tax reform advisory panel</a>.  You probably didn't hear about it since this tax subsidy is one of the most cherished by middle- and upper-middle class voters.

It will be interesting to see if Donovan calls for this type of tax reform to fund affordable housing.  It will certainly not be politically popular and such a position can be easily spun by critics to the point of irrationality.  But, the subsidy is a bit absurd--a million bucks is quite a bit of money; plus you can deduct the interest on your second home.

Given that the HUD director doesn't have much influence over tax policy, Donovan's opinions on this issue are probably superfluous.  But it wouldn't be surprising to see a cantankerous senator bring it up during his confirmation hearings.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Traffic Decreases, Transit Increases in New York City</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/nyregion/14traffic.html?_r=1&ref=nyregion">New York Times today reports</a> on a study of economic growth and transportation in Manhattan.   Looking at the period between 2003-2007, as jobs and population increased, automobile traffic actually declined while transit ridership increased.

Conventional wisdom suggests that MORE traffic is generated with economic activity.  What the study shows, however, is that people tended to shift modes, finding transit to be a viable alternative to driving.

Certainly New York City is a unique environment with a transit infrastructure capable of accommodating growth.  But these results suggest that there is not an inherent antipathy towards transit.  If it is made safe, convenient, and frequent many people will take advantage of it.

The article discusses how the MTA is ill-equipped to deal with expanding demand and is contemplating raising fares and cutting service.  This is something that is being felt throughout the country.

Hopefully, as the Obama administration puts together its economic stimulus package for "green" development and infrastructure, it will take into account the opportunities presented by transit expansion and improvement.

		<title>Problems With the New Cycling Commuter Benefit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/green/chi-mon-bike-commuter-benefit-dec15,0,1747898.story">Chicago Tribune today has an article</a> about some of the problems associated with the new <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=223">bicycle commuter benefit</a> that was tucked into the financial industry bailout bill earlier this year.

The provision provides a $20 tax-free monthly benefit to people whose commute "substantially" includes cycling.  According to the article, there is little clarity in how the benefit will be allocated, what constitutes "substantial" cycling, and what the benefit will cover (e.g. accessories, maintenance, health club membership foor shower access).

Another shortcoming of the benefit is that it does not interface with other commuter tax-benefits.  For instance, workers can get in excess of $100 of tax-free benefits for transit.  If you, say bike to the train, you would have to choose which benefit to take.

The IRS will likely provide guidance on how businesses can comply with the new law, but gray areas will likely persist.

On this issue of commuter tax benefits, one perversity of the current law that Congress ought to rectify is the parking benefit.  In addition to the transit (and now) cycling benefit, employers can choose to provide a $220/month tax-free PARKING benefit.

In a time of energy insecurity and problems of global climate change, this type of incentive (along with being regressive) is counter-productive.  It would be interesting to see the numbers on this, but I suspect that closing that loophole could raise a not-insignificant sum for transit/pedestrian/cycling programs.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Obama Officially Announces Environmental Team; Mentions Poznan</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=282</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=276">were no surprises</a> today as Barack Obama officially announced his major environmental officials: Nobel laureate Steven Chu for Secretary of Energy; Lisa Jackson for head of the EPA; Nancy Sutley for the head of the Council on Environmental Quality; and former EPA head, Carol Browner, as a special White House Adviser on climate policy.

It was interesting to see what he mentioned in his <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2008/12/remarks_of_president-elect_oba.php">announcement</a>.  He said he spoke with John Kerry after the senator's trip to the UN climate change talks in Poznan and characterized his vision of the US role in upcoming negotiations: "America will lead not just at the negotiating table - we will lead, as we always have, through innovation and discovery; through hard work and the pursuit of a common purpose."

I may be reading too much into this, but it is interesting that he stressed "innovation and discovery"--i.e., a technical fix--in relation to the UN talks.  While he has previously mentioned support for (somewhat weak) mitigation targets for CO2 emissions in the past, the focus on "innovation and discovery" at the expense of mitigation is what Bush's people have been stressing for years.

In fact, at last week's conference in Poznan, Bush's top environmental adviser, Jim Connaughton, posited trade barriers that impede technology transfer between the developed and less developed world as the main problem facing the response to climate change.  Under this logic, more free trade equals a better response to climate change.

From the standpoint of international discussions, the main issue at hand is the need to have developed countries agree to strong, binding emissions targets.  Today's speech could have been another opportunity for Obama to stress this challenge, but it didn't make the cut.

Regardless, these are pretty strong picks for the President-elect and a dramatic change of course from the oil company lobbyists who largely made up the Bush team.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Battle is On for a Green Economic Stimulus</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After President-elect Obama made his pledge earlier this month to pass an economic stimulus package that involves "the single largest new investment in our national infrastructure" since the 1950s, <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=270">I had expressed a bit of concern</a> that he mentioned building highways and roads without saying anything about mass transit.

It seems that i wasn't the only one with concerns.  <a href="http://thehill.com/business--lobby/transit-lobby-aims-to-halt-construction-2008-12-16.html">The Hill reports</a> about accelerated efforts by environmental and smart growth groups to push a package that focuses on highway maintenance, transit, and multimodal transport instead of a simple, single-minded road expansion effort. They recognize that the highway lobby has limitless resources and are attempting to be proactive in getting a green agenda heard in Congress and with the new administration.

The coalition--called <a href="http://t4america.org/">Transportation for America</a>--has called for $100 billion of the stimulus package to be spent on repairing existing infrastructure (roads, bridges, and transit), building new public transit amenities, developing inter-city high-speed rail, and making pedestrian enhancements.

One major theme of the debate is going to be how to get the most short-term economic activity going through the stimulus package. Large infrastructure projects (both highways and transit) take months of engineering & environmental studies. However, according to the Hill article, the transit coalition has identified $33 billion worth of "shovel-ready" projects.

There will be heavy lobbying on the package from well-funded industries like trucking concerns and the Chamber of Commerce who would rather see highways get priority. If the Transportation for America coalition receives a favorable response in the final legislation, it will shed some insight on the capacity of he new Democratic agenda to embody actual change.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>LaHood For Transportation Secretary?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As Obama gets to the end of the list of cabinet positions to fill, there is increased speculation about who might wind up as Transportation secretary.

It might be <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=274">futile to speculate</a> on the rumor mill, but I hope <a href="http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/lahood-considered-for-cabinet-post-2008-12-17.html">The Hill's report</a> that former Republican Representative Ray LaHood is in the running for chief of Transportation is unfounded.

It would be a vote of confidence in his green agenda if Obama appointed a smart growth guru as Transportation Secretary.  LaHood does not fit that bill.

How about <a href="http://blumenauer.house.gov/">Rep. Earl Blumenauer</a>?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New Climate Change Wiki</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After only minimal progress was made towards a post-Kyoto climate treaty in Poznan last week, the coming months are going to be marked by bursts of activity on the part of member nations seeking to establish negotiating positions.  Countries are going to want to be seen as being proactive in order to influence discussions in ways that serve their interests while also maintaining engagement internationally as cooperative global citizens seeking to solve the problem of global warming.

For instance, just over the past couple of days we have seen <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/business/story/0,28124,24806039-36418,00.html">Australia</a> and the <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKLH67594420081217">European Union</a> make progress on greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies.  With Barack Obama set to occupy the US presidency next month, there may be progress on that end, as well.

With all of this change going on, I thought it would be useful to create an interactive wiki at <a href="http://bartling.pbwiki.com/">http://bartling.pbwiki.com</a> to keep track of the positions of various countries as we proceed to the Bonn meeting in June and, ultimately, Copenhagen, next year.

If you go to that page, you will see that I have developed a brief template that presents the key information on mitigation strategies in a capsule form.  The idea is that it can allow casual visitors to easily comprehend the general positions and actions of the major players.

The wiki allows anyone to register and make changes to the web page.  I know that readers of this page come from all over the world, so I am hoping that people from various regions can contribute the latest information from their region on the wiki.

I am not sure if I have seen a compilation of each country's position presented in one place--if something exists, please let me know in the comments or via email [Hugh (at) hughbartling.com].]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Canadian Cities Pushing for Big Chunk of Bailout for Transit</title>

I haven't been following the Canadian discussions too closely, but I was impressed by the report saying that half of the $33 billion bailout plan will go to municipalities.  It is estimated by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities that Canadian cities need $23 billion to meet their current transit project needs.

It will be interesting to see compare the Canadian investment in cities with the plan being developed in the US.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Is Chicago Moving Toward a Congestion Charge?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today's <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/1339311,CST-NWS-Tax19.article">Chicago Sun Times reports</a> on an ordinance that was introduced at Wednesday's city council meeting which would effectively institute a congestion charge for downtown Chicago.

The details are sketchy, but it appears that the scheme would be less ambitious than the congestion zone for all private vehicles that you see in London.

They seem to be proposing a charge which focuses on parking and which is variable, going up or down as conditions warrant to insure a 10-15% vacancy rate.  There would also be a fee levied on trucks blocking traffic whilst making deliveries.

The promising aspect of this scheme is that the money generated from the charge would be put into a congestion relief account that would fund transit and traffic modernization projects.  Conceptually, the plan is on the right track.  Now, we'll have to see how the ordinance changes as it works its way through the council.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/dec/23/carbon-emissions-uk">Guardian has a report</a> that illustrates the issue of global equity in the climate change debate.  According to an unpublished government-led energy efficiency audit of 18,000 public buildings in England and Wales, the combined CO2 emissions level exceeds that of the entire country of Kenya.

Many buildings audited received failing grades, including the office of the minister in charge of climate change policy.  The fact that 18,000 buildings in the UK generate more CO2 emissions than a country of 39 million people should offer some perspective on the position of developing countries: namely, that per capita emissions reduction targets are the proper measure of response to climate change challenges.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Tennessee Suffers Toxic Spill 30 Times Larger Than Exxon Valdez</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This has gotten almost no attention in the US press, but two days ago in Tennessee <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/24/us/24mud.html">a fly ash retention pond at a coal-fired power plant was breached</a> causing 1.7 million cubic yards of toxic sludge to flow into a tributary of the Tennessee River.

Fly ash is a byproduct of coal incineration and contains harmful levels of mercury, lead, arsenic, and other heavy metals.  Luckily the plant--in Kingston, Tennessee--is not in a highly populated area, <a href="http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=72573&catid=2">however 12 homes were damaged </a>and scores of others saw their property littered with dead fish.  <a href="http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=72524&catid=2">According to the head of the TVA</a>, the sludge pit had experienced seepage in the past.

This should give caution to coal enthusiasts like incoming President Barack Obama who intends to promote what he calls "clean coal" as a method to sequester carbon in the effort to address issues of climate change.

Even if you were able to successfully sequester carbon from coal-fired power plants (<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2201661/">a dubious proposition</a>), it still has a host of other hazards.  In addition to the toxic sludge issue, the <a href="http://www.appvoices.org/index.php?/frontporch/blogposts/the_good_news_bad_news_and_good_news_again/">process of coal extraction in Appalachia is insidious</a> as it disrupts water quality and hydrological cycles from "mountaintop removal."  It also is an extremely <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/29/AR2008022903390.html">dangerous industry for workers</a>.

Hopefully Congress and Obama's energy team will remember the spill in Kingston as they deliberate about future energy policy.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>First Job for Waxman: Investigate the Kingston, TN Coal Ash Disaster</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=294</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If Henry Waxman wants to make a statement that the time has arrived for a serious debate about the country's energy future, climate change, deregulation, and policy effectiveness, his first act as the new chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee should be to launch hearings into last month's coal ash spill in eastern Tennessee.

The spill of toxic-laden coal ash was the largest such spill in US history, spewing <a href="http://timesfreepress.com/news/2008/dec/31/tennessee-questions-persists-spill/?local">a billion gallons</a> into a tributary of the Tennessee River.  The Teneessee Valley Authority took days to test the water and data from the test have not been publically released.  In addition, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/02/us/02sludge.html?_r=1">New York Times is reporting</a> that the TVA tests were conducted UPSTREAM from the spill.  Today the <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/jan/02/epa-elevated-levels-arsenic-found-near-spill/">EPA released its test results and data</a> which indicated that levels of arsenic in the water are 100 times the maximum safety threshold.

<a href="http://www.appvoices.org/index.php?/frontporch/blogposts/preliminary_tests_find_high_levels_of_toxic_chemicals_in_harriman_tn_fly_as/">Independent tests were conducted by scientists at Appalachian State University</a> which indicate even higher levels of arsenic as well as troubling levels of lead and thallium.

Congress needs to take a hard look at the regulations governing fly ash waste so as to insure that the possibilities of such dramatic disasters are minimized--especially as coal state politicians like Barack Obama push the canard of "clean coal" to solve our energy and climate problems.

Trapping carbon from burning coal is a separate issue from dealing with the waste.  And the fly ash waste problem is not confined to Tennessee.  A simple google news search brings up concerns with <a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2009/01/mostthorough-study-yet-flyash-course-near-completion">arsenic levels in Virginia</a>, a <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2008/12/29/daily26.html">$54 million dollar lawsuit in Maryland</a> against Constellation Power for contaminating ground water, and <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20090101/NEWS/901010354/1001/NEWS">energy interests stifiling proposed regulations</a> of fly ash in Iowa.

After eight years of little federal oversight on power company operations, the Kingston Disaster should be a serious wake-up call.  It looks like Senator Boxer is doing the right thing.  <a href="http://www.cleanenergy.org/hottopics/index.cfm?id=107">She has scheduled the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works</a> to look at the Kingston Disaster next Thursday, 8 January at 10am est.  Waxman should join in.

For more information and updates on the situation in Kingston, I would recommend monitoring the websites of the <a href="http://www.cleanenergy.org/hottopics/index.cfm?id=105">Southern Alliance for Clean Energy</a> [check out their <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cleanenergy">flickr stream</a> for first hand pictures of the disaster] and the <a href="http://www.ilovemountains.org/tvaspill/">I Love Mountains</a> coalition.  One thing that the region has going for it is a vibrant community of dedicated environmentalists.  Their efforts need support from folks across the country [and the world] for policy reform to succeed.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US Agribusiness Gearing Up to Challenge Greenhouse Gas Regulations</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=295</link>
		<pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2009 05:23:14 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the big challenges for the incoming Obama administration is how they intend to deal with the issue of regulating greenhouse gas emissions.  The US Supreme Court has ruled that the EPA can regulate GHGs, but Bush's EPA has basically run out the clock, failing to push along the regulatory process.

On the whole, this is probably a good thing, given the penchant the Bush administration has had to gut existing environmental regulations.  However, the Obama administration is going to be inheriting a can of worms, with interest groups of every different stripe motivated to influence the regulatory process.

Following the court ruling, the EPA began taking public comment on <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/anpr.html">a possible regulatory regime</a>.  The official, intial comment period ended in November, although the EPA is still accepting late comments and posting them in the <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/search/search_results.jsp?css=0&N=0&Ntk=All&Ntx=mode+matchall&Ne=2+8+11+8053+8054+8098+8074+8066+8084+8055&Ntt=OAR-2008-0318&sid=11E9ABF86CB0">docket</a>.

In its initial notice for proposed rulemaking, the EPA mentioned the need to control methane--a highly potent greenhouse gas.  While CO2 is the major contributor to our total greenhouse gas emissions inventory, methane (CH4) is a serious problem and livestock enteric fermentation and manure management are among the biggest sources of methane.  The EPA's initial notice speculated about ways to manage these emissions and suggested that we look to regulating certain high-GHG agricultural practices.

This set off alarm bells in the highly-organized agribusiness community who are now interpreting any attempts at EPA regulation of livestock operations as tantamount to a "cow tax."  There hasn't been much coverage of this in the big metropolitan papers.  But there are scores of outraged op-eds in smaller regional papers throughout the country: for example, see the <a href="http://www.tonawanda-news.com/opinion/local_story_358004340.html?keyword=topstory">Tonawanda NY News</a>, the <a href="http://www.pjstar.com/news/x512371245/EPA-working-on-so-called-cow-tax">Peoria IL Journal-Star</a>, or the <a href="http://www.aberdeennews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081214/OPINION03/812140332/-1/NEWS01">Aberdeen SD American News</a>.

The fear-mongering seems to have had some impact on politicians with influential Senators such as <a href="http://www.observertoday.com/page/content.detail/id/516549.html?nav=5047">Chuck Schumer</a> explicitly inveighing against a "cow tax" and <a href="http://www.hpj.com/archives/2008/dec08/dec22/Thunesayscattleexemptionbil.cfm">Republican John Thune</a> introducing a bill to exempt livestock operations from EPA regulations.

It would be unwise to ignore the methane problem simply because of the power of agribusiness interests to skew the debate over methane regulation--but their organizational acumen and influence on the Hill. unfortunately, might make these efforts successful.]]></content:encoded>

One of his more low-cost, and largely symbolic proposals is to have the new president establish a farming operation on the White House grounds.  Given the renaissance in urban agriculture and consumer demand for locally-grown food, having a White House farmer could raise the visibility of the localvore movement and perhaps prompt policymakers in Washington to start asking questions about the viability of our current system of incentives.
<a href="http://whitehousefarmer.com/">A group of activists have started a website</a> where you can nominate a farmer for the post.  Shortly after inauguration they will send a list of nominations to the new administration.  It is unclear how Obama will react to the suggestion--although one of his favorite Chicago chefs, Rick Bayless, is a great propoent of local food systems.  It would be a great symbolic gesture to transform the ecologically-problematic White House lawn into a space of healthy productive cultivation.]]></content:encoded>

It is unclear from the article how Newman calculated his estimates, but the findings seem logical.  Low-density, sprawling development costs more to maintain since the basic infrastructure serves a smaller number of people, whilst simultaneously generating excessive greenhouse gases.

I am not too familiar with Sydney's geography, but from reading Newman's work over the years, it seems that many of Australia's cities suffer from the same type of low-density, automotive-dominated sprawl we see in North America.  In a <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/perthlings-please-take-us-to-your-railway-system/2009/01/05/1231003932983.html">companion editorial</a>, Newman cites a common issue when municipalities want to develop higher density land use regimes: resistance from many citizens.  Balancing opposition to higher density with the environmental benefits seems to be a challenge down under, as well.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is correct. The Sydney Basin has the sea on the east and the Blue Mountains basically in an arc around to the west so space is becoming limited. "The Australian Dream" of owning your own home on a block of land with garden and trees is very strong. So when Local (and State) Governments attempt to introduce medium or high density housing along transport routes in the suburbs, there is strong opposition from residents who want to maintain their bushy surroundings and preserve biodiversity in their parklands.
Many of us would like to see more and better public transport around Sydney to reduce greenhouse emissions from cars. It's a big debate here at the moment.]]></wp:comment_content>

I've always wanted to read more on Canberra since it is an early 20th century planned community (with a Chicago connection).  I would think that land use might be a bit more environmentally appropriate there given the time period in which it was planned.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Another Kingston TN Coal Ash Disaster Could Happen Elsewhere</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/us/07sludge.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">New York Times had a nice front page story Wednesday</a> on the lack of nationwide regulations in the United States for the treatment and disposal of coal ash.  It was the breaching of a  retention pond holding a stew of coal ash and water that resulted in last month's Kingston, Tennessee disaster, spewing millions of tons of toxic chemicals into a tributary of the Tennessee River.

The article highlights the fact that the federal EPA does not have national regulations on how to dispose of solid wastes from coal-fired power plants and estimates that there are over 1300 ash ponds similar to Kingston's, governed by a patchwork of (often lax) state regulations.

EPA scientists have been studying the hazards posed by coal ash and concluded in 2000 that coal ash should be treated as a hazardous waste, but when Bush officials took over the EPA in 2001 they put the kibosh on developing regulations.

Thursday at 10am est, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works will be holding a <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Hearings.Hearing&Hearing_ID=8e2cbe63-802a-23ad-46ea-16ca4422e7d9">hearing</a> on the issue featuring the head of the TVA, Tom Kilgore, and local activists.

On Wednesday, <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/jan/08/roane-residents-bring-spills-effects-to-dc/">affected residents made the rounds on Capitol Hill</a> and gave select members of Congress jars filled with the toxic sludge as a physical reminder of the disaster.   Residents and activists are calling for coal ash to be regulated as hazardous waste and the <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/jan/08/feds-may-help-tva-go-green/">Knoxville News Sentinel is reporting </a>that key House members support the idea.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Recap on Senate Hearing on Kingston Coal Ash Disaster</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I just finished watching the live feed of the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Hearings.Hearing&Hearing_ID=8e2cbe63-802a-23ad-46ea-16ca4422e7d9">Senate Environment and Public Works hearing</a> on the Kingston, TN coal ash spill.  Here are some initial impressions:
<ul>
	<li>Chair Barbara Boxer did a good job pushing TVA CEO Tom Kilgore on safety issues and general TVA approach to dealing with coal ash waste.  He wasn't altogether forthcoming in his answers and disappointingly wasn't enthusiastic about the possible federal regulation of coal ash as a hazardous waste.  Currently coal ash is regulated at the state level.</li>
	<li>Boxer indicated she intends to press Obama's appointee to head the EPA on the issue of coal ash regulation at her confirmation hearings next week.</li>
	<li>I was struck by how many committee members were absent from the hearing, especially those who claim to be strong on the environment like Lieberman, Sanders, and Klobuchar [I am assuming that these folks are still on the committee]. The only Republicans who bothered to show up were the ranking member, James Inhofe, and Tennessee's Lamar Alexander [there may have been one other I'm forgetting].  The new senator from New Mexico, Tom Udall, had good questions.</li>
	<li>Witness, Steven Smith, of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, was effective at stating the case for stronger oversight on coal ash and the TVA.  His <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=e918d2f7-9e8b-411e-b244-9a3a7c3359d9">prepared testimony [.pdf] </a>offers a comprehensive treatment of the Kingston disaster and the general issue of dealing with waste from coal fired power plants.</li>
	<li>The final witness, Rowan County Director of Emergency Management, Howie Rose, gave <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=8e9bc83a-31e5-456b-a364-100df524c342">compelling testimony [.pdf]</a> of the immediate response to the disaster.  Among the challenges faced by local authorities was the TVA's failure to follow emergency procedures.  The first reports of the breach of the ash pit came in to local authorities at 12:40am on December 22 and emergency responders were on the scene shortly after 1:00am.  The TVA didn't appear on the scene until nearly 5:00am.  Rose pointed out that the TVA has a relatively lax emergency preparedness procedure for their coal plants in comparison to their nuclear and hydroelectric facilities.</li>
</ul>
In sum, there were no ground breaking revelations in the hearings.  The most disheartening aspect was the lack of attendance by the bulk of the committee.  This is especially disappointing given the sheer scale of the disaster.  It will be interesting to see how it plays in the press tomorrow.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Preview of the Copenhagen Climate Talks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/un-climate-conference-the-countdown-to-copenhagen-1242601.html">The Independent reminds us</a> that there are only 331 days until the UN climate talks begin in Copenhagen.  The article is a good primer for the uninitiated and gives a sense of the real urgency for a global agreement to effectively address global warming.

One thing the article does is to nicely and pithily articulate the three major issues to be worked out over the course of the next 11 months.  The first challenge is getting the industrialized countries to agree to strong binding reductions of greenhouse gases.  The second is getting developing countries--especially India and China--to agree to reducing their emissions somewhere below the projected "business as usual" levels.  Finally, there needs to be an adequately funded mechanism that will provide the poorest countries in the world resources to adapt to the changing climate in the immediate term.

These are the main three issues.  The US is being looked to as a leader given the change in administration; so it will be important to closely watch how Obama and his advisers stake out their positions based on these three issues.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Energy Secretary-Designate, Steven Chu Endorses &#034;Clean Coal&#034;?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Obama's nominee for Secretary of Energy is appearing before the <a href="http://energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Home.Home">US Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources </a>today for his <a href="http://energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Hearings.Testimony&Hearing_ID=a71a3a1f-a497-7c36-a9f4-b4b37844f1fb&Witness_ID=71376245-97ee-4acb-a88d-f8854402646c">confirmation hearing</a>.  Given his <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/19a9fba6-e0e4-11dd-b0e8-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1">long record of concern about climate change</a>, it was inevitable that he would be asked about the role of coal as part of the US energy strategy.

I haven't been watching the hearings, but according to the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/environmentalcapital/2009/01/13/steven-chu-okay-coals-just-a-pretty-bad-dream/">Wall Street Journal</a>, Chu parried questions about his past statement that coal is his "<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/environmentalcapital/2008/12/11/steven-chu-coal-is-my-worst-nightmare/">worst nightmare</a>," by saying that he is "hopeful and optimistic that we can figure out how to use coal in a clean way."

It is likely he is parsing his words in the face of Senate interrogation, since <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE50C4CX20090113">Reuters is reporting</a> that he is also simultaneously sticking to his guns at the hearing about the urgency of climate change.  Chu is expected to be approved without a hitch, so we will likely get to see how he deals with these challenges once in office.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Blagojevich Signs &#034;Clean Coal&#034; Bill</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Impeached Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich isn't going to let the threat of federal prosecution stop him from executing gubernatorial duties.

<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-clean-coaljan13,0,2446728.story">Today he signed</a> the Clean Coal Portfolio Standard which provides an $18 million subsidy to the energy company, <a href="http://www.tenaska.com/">Tenaska</a>, for an engineering study with the ultimate goal of building a "clean coal" plant in Taylorville, Illinois.

Blago's latest move isn't nearly as controversial as his tapping of Roland Burris to fill the state's vacant senate seat.  The <a href="http://www.cleancoalillinois.com/news-081125-HR.html">legislation was hashed out last year</a> by Attorney General Lisa Madigan and requires Illinois utilities ultimately to buy at least 5% of their electricity from the plant.  The plant, in turn, will capture 50% of the plant's greenhouse gas emissions through sequestration and ultimately produce a natural gas component from the coal.

The sequestered CO2 will apparently either be sent to oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico or stored underground elsewhere--I guess the initial engineering study will answer that question.  I am <a href="http://climaticidechronicles.org/2009/01/02/james-hansen-sends-a-letter-to-michelle-and-barack-obama/">generally sympathetic to James Hansen's call</a> for more research and development for carbon capture and sequestration, but <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/798">it is unclear how soon cost-effective</a> technology can be feasible.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Questions for Ray LaHood - Obama&#039;s Pick for Transportation</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=303</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2009 17:25:06 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, Ray LaHood, Obama's pick for Secretary of Transportation, was supposed to appear before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation committee for his confirmation hearing.  However, the hearing <a href="http://www.trafficworld.com/newssection/government.asp?id=49383">has been postponed</a> as "simply a matter of procedure," according to committee chair, Jay Rockefeller.

The postponment comes on the heels of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/13/AR2009011302860.html?hpid=sec-politics">a story published in the Washington Pos</a>t about LaHood's penhcant for inserting earmark spending into appropriation bills as a member of the House of Representatives--including $9 million that was funneled to campaign donors.  Obama has said that he opposes earmarks, so expect some tough questioning of LaHood on this front.

I am especially interested in his ties to William Cellini, the indicted head of the Illinois Asphault Paving Association, who <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/1251481,cellini_indicted103008.article">acted to shakedown donors</a> for disgraced Governor Rod Blagojevich.  Many of LaHood's earmarks were paving projects that would benefit Cellini's members.

LaHood should also be asked about his failure to support the <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/legislation?id=0237">National Highway Bridge Reconstruction and Inspection Act</a> which was passed after the tragic bridge collapse in Minnesota to improve bridge safety.

Since transportation and environmental impacts are so interlinked, LaHood should also be asked about his <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/IL/Ray_LaHood_Environment.htm">questionable environmental record</a>.  While many of his problematic votes were not explicitly related to transportation--such as his opposition to a bill that would <a href="http://getenergysmartnow.com/2008/06/13/greening-the-school-house/">provide grants for enhancing energy efficiency in schools</a>--it seems important for the Committee to make it clear that he needs to understand the connection.

Of the many great picks Obama has made for cabinet positions, the choice of LaHood at Transportation still remains a mystery.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I didn't get a chance to watch the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Hearings.Hearing&Hearing_ID=ae2c3342-802a-23ad-4788-d1962403eb76">Senate hearings</a> yesterday for Obama's EPA nominee, Lisa Jackson, and Council on Environmental Quality head, Nancy Stuckey, but the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/14/AR2009011400323.html?hpid=sec-politics">press accounts indicated</a> that we are likely to see a significant change in orientation toward environmental policy with the new administration.

While asserting that science will once again be brought to the center of decision making at EPA, Jackson played her cards close to the chest on the controversial prospect of EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases.  But she apparently <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/guest/22499/">was positive about granting a waiver to California</a> and other states to institute their own, more stringent, CO2 tailpipe emissions standards.  Auto companies have been battling this decision for months, arguing that it is too expensive to meet multiple standards nationwide.  Bush's EPA administrator, Steven Johnson, consequently sat on the request.

Granting the waiver would be quite significant given the fact that several other states have signed on to the proposed California standards.  Unlike a change in the national automobile fuel efficiency standards that would take an act of Congress to modify, the EPA administrator has the sole authority to grant the California waiver.

On the issue of coal ash regulation--which gained greater urgency due to last month's disaster in Tennessee--<a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/jan/15/epa-designate-jackson-vows-look-ways-regulate-toxi/">Jackson said she would immediately look at the issue of federal regulation</a>.  It is pretty clear that EPA has the authority to define coal ash as a hazardous waste; but up until now each state has been responsible for regulation which some critics argue results in lax enforcement and an enhanced possibility for hazardous spills.

On the coal ash front, yesterday West Virginia Democratic Congressman <a href="http://sundaygazettemail.com/News/200901140863">Nick Rahall introduced a bill</a> that would require federal standards for coal sludge storage ponds.  This doesn't get at the issue of regulating the ash as a hazardous waste, but it would contribute to greater standardization of storage practices.

One of the amusing things about watching Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearings is to see what kind of craziness Oklahoma senator and climate-change denier James Inhofe comes up with.  It seems that he was relatively calm <a href="http://thehill.com/business--lobby/jackson-indicates-resolve-to-move-forward-on-carbon-emission-rules-2009-01-14.html">merely asking Jackson</a> to read one of his speeches.

After Jackson's questioning, Nancy Sutley appeared.  She is the nominee for the chair of the Council on Environmental Quality--which basically entails being the top environmental adviser in the White House.  <a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2009/1/14/142141/038">There did appear to be some legitimate questioning</a> about how her role will be affected by Obama's plan to have Carol Browner be the "climate czar."  The current CEQ head, James Connaughton, has basically directed climate change policy for Bush.  Sutley was actually a top deputy to Browner when she ran the EPA under Clinton, so it is hoped that they would have a cooperative relationship.  A larger question is what power Browner will actually have in the absence of being the head of a large bureaucracy.  There is a tendency for "czars" to fall through the organizational cracks unless they have continual access to the President.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Transportation Proposals in Democratic Stimulus Plan</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=305</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2009/01/summary_american_recovery_and_reinvestment.php">Congressional Democrats have just released some detailed numbers</a> that will form the basis of economic stimulus legislation that Obama wants to sign into law by mid-February.  It will be interesting to see the reactions from reform groups, like those associated with <a href="http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/">Smart Growth America</a>, who have likely been directly involved in Congressional discussions.

Nonetheless, here are some initial impressions about the transportation element.
<blockquote>Highway Infrastructure: $30 billion for highway and bridge construction projects. It is estimated that states have over 5,100 projects totaling over $64 billion that could be awarded within 180 days. These projects create jobs in the short term while saving commuters time and money in the long term. In 2006, the Department of Transportation estimated $8.5 billion was needed to maintain current systems and $61.4 billion was needed to improve highways and bridges.</blockquote>
The devil, of course, is in the details.  It appears that the <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKN1341897020090114?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">$64 billion figure for "shovel ready" projects</a> comes from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.  I am not familiar with their study, but some of the <a href="http://www.transportation.org/news/184.aspx">statements coming from AASHTO officials</a> suggest that highway expansion and new roads are heavily weighted in this figure.  As <a href="http://t4america.org/">Transportation for America implies</a>, maintenance money for bridges and highways should be prioritized over new road and highway construction.  Using the stimulus package to exacerbate sprawl will simply cause further air quality and carbon emissions further down the line.
<blockquote>Transit: Public transportation saves Americans time and money, saving as much as 4.2 billion gallons of gasoline and reducing carbon emissions by 37 million metric tons each year.

· New Construction: $1 billion for Capital Investment Grants for new commuter rail or other light rail systems to increase public use of mass transit and to speed projects already in construction. The Federal Transit Administration has $2.4 billion in pre-approved projects.

· Upgrades and Repair: $2 billion to modernize existing transit systems, including renovations to stations, security systems, computers, equipment, structures, signals, and communications. Funds will be distributed through the existing formula. The repair backlog is nearly $50 billion.

· Transit Capital Assistance: $6 billion to purchase buses and equipment needed to increase public transportation and improve intermodal and transit facilities. The Department of Transportation estimates a $3.2 billion maintenance backlog and $9.2 billion in needed improvements. The American Public Transportation Association identified 787 ready-to-go transit projects totaling $15.5 billion. Funds will be distributed through the existing formulas.

Amtrak and Intercity Passenger Rail Construction Grants: $1.1 billion to improve the speed and capacity of intercity passenger rail service. The Department of Transportation's Inspector General estimates the North East Corridor alone has a backlog of over $10 billion.</blockquote>
On the transit/Amtrak side, we continue to see lack of parity with regard to highway financing--approximately $10 billion. What is interesting is to note the disparities between the demand for financing and what is proposed in the bill.  Whereas the bill gives about half of the financing needed for highway projects, in the areas of transit upgrade/repair and Amtrak, the proposed federal contributions are rather minimal.

It is also interesting to note that the $10 billion figure is significantly lower than what <a href="http://www.apta.com/government_affairs/washrep/2009january07.cfm">Rep. James Oberstar--head of the House Transport Committee--had been calling for in recent days</a>.  He called for $12.5 billion for transit, $3.4 billion for high speed rail, and $1.5 billion for Amtrak.

It appears that this document is from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/business/economy/16webstimulus.html?ref=business">House side</a>--it remains to be seen what the Senate will come up with.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Cash for Clunkers Legislation Gaining Steam in Senate</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have posted on <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=208">"cash for clunkers" schemes</a> in the past.  A <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSTRE50D7TK20090114">couple</a> of <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28663037/">articles</a> published this week suggest that the idea may be getting some support in the US Congress.  Senator Diane Feinstein <a href="http://feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=NewsRoom.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=d6137935-0a4f-1ab7-ddb4-8a1760ea170c&Region_id=&Issue_id=">has a run down</a> of the proposed legislation at her website, and it looks promising.

The idea behind it is creating an incentive for retiring older, high-emission cars.  Depending on the age and fuel efficiency profile of the car, consumers would have their car scrapped.  In exchange they will get up to $4,500 for the purchase of a vehicle with high fuel economy.  They could also opt to get a smaller subsidy for public transit.

While I am generally hesitant to endorse subsidizing automobiles, this scheme is pretty sensible and politically pragmatic.  Taking older cars off the road results in lower greenhouse gas emissions and better air quality.  Furthermore, offering a significant transit benefit may get a number of people to give up automobile ownership altogether.  In an ideal world, the incentive would just be limited to rewarding transit for scrapping the car; but the purchase of new cars will also help the beleaguered auto industry and provide incentives to build fuel efficient vehicles.

Canada has just initiated a similar scheme--however, theirs does not have the transit benefit.  This scheme is no substitute for a carbon tax in terms of reducing emissions, but it would likely have some impact.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I normally proceed with caution when comparing the US political system with those of other countries.  However, given the connections that many US conservatives have cultivated with UK conservatives over the years,  I think it may be useful to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jan/16/energyefficiency-alternativeenergy">acknowledge efforts</a> on the part of the current Tory leader, David Cameron, to "out-Green" his Liberal counterparts.

Most recently, Cameron, has proposed spending £1bn to develop a smart grid for the country's electricity system that would install interactive meters in British households.  The meters would allow consumers to shift usage to maximize the system's capacity.  He is also proposing £6,500 for each British homeowner to use for efficiency improvements.

The extent to which Cameron's green stance should be attributable to simply being in the opposition is a good question.  Is this merely posturing?  Or does it represent an actual shift in a more progressive policy stance by the Tories?  In some sense, the fact that Cameron thinks of this issue as one he can leverage is significant.

British environmental journalist/activist, <a href="http://www.monbiot.com/">George Monbiot</a>, has a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jan/16/monbiot-tory">pretty good assessment </a>of the Tory shift in the Guardian.  He approaches the Tory plans with a dose of healthy skepticism, but asserts that "there is plenty here that thrills."

From this side of the Atlantic, it is interesting to see the rhetorical shift in Conservative politics.  After John McCain's humiliating defeat in last year's elections, it is clear that the Republican party needs to re-think their fundamental positions on issues in order to be competitive in the near term.  Obviously, the fact that McCain had to follow in the wake of Bush's disastrous term wasn't helpful.  Yet, much of his problem was self-inflicted by running to base issues of anti-intellectualism and intolerance.

It will be interesting to see if Republicans might drift to green issues as a way to steady their ship in the next few months.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bush Administration Issues Last Minute Gift to DuPont</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday was the last official working day for the Bush Administration and environmentalists were looking to see what sorts of rules and regulations would be issued by various agencies on their way out the door.

According to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/16/AR2009011604415.html?hpid=sec-health">Washington Post</a>, the EPA issued a <a href="http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/criteria/drinking/pha-PFOA_PFOS.pdf">Provisional Health Advisory [.pdf]</a> for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) yesterday.

PFOA is a chemical commonly found in plastic coatings, such as Teflon [produced by DuPont] and is known to cause cancer and reproductive problems.  The EPA advisory lists an exposure standard at 0.4 parts per billion--which was roundly criticized as extremely weak by environmentalists.

The good news is that incoming EPA administrator, Lisa Jackson, had issued  restrictions on the chemical that were 10 times as stringent when she was head of New Jersey's state EPA.  Obama's transition team has stated numerous times that it would review last-minute rules & regulations issued by the Bush Administration.
The <a href="http://sundaygazettemail.com/News/200901140812">Charleston Gazette has a great article</a> on the issue of PFOAs including DuPont's efforts to weaken regulatory action both at the national and state levels.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Obama Team Already Reining in Cabinet Pick Ray LaHood</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=311</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When people have questioned some of Obama's cabinet picks for holding views and having experience that appear to be problematically conventional, the President-elect has responded by saying that <a href="http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/11/26/1689626.aspx">"change comes from me."</a>

Given the sheer size of the federal bureaucracy and the breadth of the federal government's policy influence, insuring that his subordinates follow a vague vision of "change" will be challenging.  It seems important to choose good people with reformist visions hardwired in their character.

Thus, it is not a good sign that Obama's transition team had to force his pick for Transportation Secretary to refrain from attending a lobbyist-sponsored inaugural ball.  LaHood's name was on the program and apparently didn't think twice about the fact that the entire affair is sponsored by lobbyists and corporations--many of which may have an interest in decisions he will make as a cabinet secretary.

I <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=307">posted yesterday</a> about how LaHood canceled his appearance after the Wall Street Journal questioned the transition team about the issue.  Today, the <a href="http://www.galesburg.com/news/news_state/x1621252022/LaHood-won-t-attend-Illinois-State-Society-s-Inaugural-Gala">Galesburg Register-Mail quoted</a> LaHood as saying: "We were told by the transition (that) because there are lobbyists funding the event that we could not go."

The <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=300">Washington Post published a story last week</a> about LaHood's connections with lobbyists in the road building industry and an indicted associate of impeached Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich.  If LaHood needs to be told by the transition the no-brainer that he should avoid attending corporate lobbyist events during this high-profile week, what kind of judgment can we expect from him once the media glare subsides and the Department of Transportation moves back into relative obscurity?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Obama to EPA: Give California Clean Air Act Waiver</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/us/politics/26calif.html?_r=1&hp">New York Times is reporting</a> that President Obama is asking his EPA Administrator to move quickly on California's application for regulating tailpipe emissions.

Under the Clean Air Act, California can ask the feds for authority to set their own emissions standards--as long as they are more stringent than federal standards.  Other states can follow the lead of either California or the federal government.

California has been pushing this for months and the Bush Administration had bascially stonewalled the application.  The state has an ambitious greenhouse gas reduction plan and has targeted tailpipe emissions as a way to pressure the auto industry to produce more energy efficient cars.

At least 13 other states have indicated that they want to adopt California's regulations, so the national implications of this move are significant.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jschmidt/us_climate_change_envoy_in_place.html">Jake Schmidt at the National Resources Defense Council reports</a> that Secretary of State Clinton <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2009/01/26/stern_appointed_climate_change.html?hpid=topnews">has appointed</a> Todd Stern to be the chief US climate change negotiator in the State Department.  This quick appointment is a good move, suggesting that the administration recognizes the accelerated timetable of international negotiations and the need to be prepared to negotiate a comprehensive global emissions treaty by year's end.

Domestically, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/science/earth/27coal.html?_r=1&hp">the New York Times has a good story</a> on the impending Congressional efforts to write cap-and-trade legislation.  The article highlights the geographic fissures in the Democratic party, with delegations from the northeast and west more supportive of aggressive approaches towards reducing emissions while their midwestern colleagues are more hesitant.  Key committees in the House and Senate, however, are controlled by two Californians--Henry Waxman and Barbara Boxer--giving the more ambitious proponents a procedural advantage.

Interestingly, the article quotes Obama's chief of staff as saying that Waxman's desire to have a bill passed by the House by the end of May is "realistic."  This suggests climate change remains relatively high on the Obama agenda.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Outlook Dim for Public Transit in US</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=314</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/us/04transit.html?_r=1&ref=us">New York Times</a> has a front page article on the challenges faced by transit agencies in the US; namely, high and growing levels of ridership but not enough money to pay for existing operational costs.

The result is that transit systems across the nation are facing some combination of either cutting service or raising fares--take a look at Transportation for America's <a href="http://t4america.org/transitcuts">map</a> for a sense of the breadth of the problem.

The Times story comes as the Senate is debating how much financing should go to public transit in the nearly-$1 trillion stimulus bill.  While there has been a focus placed on improving the infrastructure through capital financing, there have been attempts to include money for operations--which could actually have a more immediate stimulus effect than capital investment--but <a href="http://blog.tstc.org/2009/02/03/stimulus-action-moves-to-senate/">they have been unsuccessful</a>.

Even if money winds up being allocated to transit operations, policymakers are going to have to take a much closer look at both federal transportation policy and its financing mechanisms.  It would make sense from the standpoint of reducing carbon emissions and increasing energy efficiency to have a national transportation policy that encourages this type of investment through both capital expenditure and operational financing.

Where this money come from is a big question.  Right now, the Highway Trust Fund is an unsustainable mechanism for raising revenue, since increased fuel efficiency actually results in less revenue raised.  Some combination of user-fees and more federal discretionary spending will have to be considered.

Once the stimulus bill gets passed, hopefully a serious dialog can begin on these larger structural problems.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm not sure, John.  I haven't looked too extensively at privatizing bus operations in the US context, but my sense is that it would be unusual to find private providers to step in somewhere like St. Louis.  In terms of transport provision, you tend to see private providers in paratransit systems where some of the costs are borne by federal sources like Medicaid.

Of course, a century ago most transit (e.g. streetcars) in US cities were private concerns--oftentimes funded by real estate developers to make properties on the urban fringe attractive to buyers.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Pew Center on Global Climate Change and the Asia Society <a href="http://www.pewclimate.org/US-China">released a report yesterday</a> laying out a roadmap for US-China cooperation on the issue of climate change.  It received a good deal of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSTRE5150T320090206">press</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/05/world/asia/05china.html?ref=world">coverage</a> primarily because the current US Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu, was involved in its production prior to his nomination.  In addition, Chinese policy officials were also involved, suggesting that the report will give insight into how US-China relations might develop around climate change.

The recommendations in the report are notable for their commitment to the UN process of developing a successor to Kyoto, but also stressing the need to pursue immediate bilateral cooperation.  Among the recommendations set forth in the document are:
<ul>
	<li>Joint development of carbon capture and sequestration technologies for coal-fired power plants</li>
	<li>Cooperation on energy efficiency measures and technologies as well as on developing "smart" electricity grids in both countries.</li>
	<li>Cooperating on standardized data collection with regard to emissions and developing financing measures.</li>
</ul>
The report also accepts as a given the idea of "common but differentiated responsibilities."  This phrase has been deployed in the UN negotiations to characterize the idea that the levels of development of particular countries need to be taken into account when structuring emissions reduction commitments.

On the whole, there is nothing dramatic in the plan's recommendations--no specific or binding targets on emissions reductions are discussed.  The focus on a technological fix for coal plants also may be troubling to some critics given that the carbon capture and sequestration technologies are untested.

But, to the extent that the document asserts the need for urgent cooperation it could be useful for laying out an immediate program that would have the potential of pushing the international talks along.  If the US and China come to some type of agreement on partnership--which will involve some type of financial incentives coming from the US for low-carbon technology deployment in China--in advance of December's UN Copenhagen meeting, then the prospects for the international agreement being signed are positive.

One of the things pushed in the report is for the two countries to have early 2009 high level ministerial talks about climate change.  This appears to be on track, as Hillary Clinton is set to make <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/02/06/ST2009020600245.html">her first overseas trip</a> as Secretary of State to China on 20 February.  <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iDkGt4K_P2D_f3au3GD4kZzulYQw">According to AFP</a>, the State Department chief climate negotiator, Todd Stern, is going to join Clinton on her trip, so the issue of climate change will certainly be on the agenda.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/feb/06/carbon-price-record-low">Guardian is reporting</a> that the price of a ton of carbon on Europe's emissions trading market has hit a record low of  €10.15.  This is down from about €40 per ton as of last July.

One reason for the price decline is due to the global recession, but the article brings up another important point: these companies were given their carbon emissions permits gratis and are now selling them to raise cash in a lackluster credit market.

I'm wondering how much an auctioning scheme would change the equation for when firms decide to sell their emissions credits.  My guess is that there would be less incentive to dump them if an initial capital outlay was needed for their acquisition.  You would probably see price drops during times of recession, but the volatility would be more muted.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Senate Votes to Deny Stimulus Money for Municipal Park Improvements</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The US Senate is voting on amendments to the multi-billion dollar stimulus package.  They just passed an <a href="http://coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=ed34f13c-a479-45fa-ba02-66eed300a24d">amendment [.pdf] </a>offered by Sen. Tom Coburn that will prohibit using stimulus funds for municipal parks by a 73-24 vote.  This is quite shortsighted given the poor condition of many municipal parks, the consistent demand for upgrades, and the immediate stimulative effect such improvements could have on the economy.
To see how specific senators voted, <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00051">click here</a>.  I am glad to report that my senators Burris and Durbin were part of the sensible minority.

Perhaps this strike against a urban livability agenda will be rectified in conference with the House of Representatives.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Car-Friendly Provision Gets Traction in Senate Stimulus Bill</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The US Senate is likely to pass a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123412571754261087.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">stimulus package today</a> or tomorrow setting the state for negotiations with the House of Representatives on a final bill to send to President Obama.

Nothing is finalized yet, but the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bc9e9490-f61d-11dd-a9ed-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1">Financial Times published an interesting article</a> this morning on provisions in the Senate bill designed to help the struggling auto industry.  Apparently an amendment sponsored by Barbara Milkulski that will give consumers a federal tax credit for interest payments and the local sales tax incurred when purchasing new automobiles.

Simultaneously, a <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20090205/ANA05/902059981/1186">"cash for clunkers" provision </a>sponsored by Tom Harkin was removed from the bill.  Harkin's provision would have given low- to middle-income consumers up to $10,000 if they traded in an old vehicle and purchased a new US-made, fuel efficient automobile.

Incentivizing more auto dependence is generally a bad idea, given the environmental costs; but at least  Harkin's amendment was tied to reducing emissions.  The Milkulski provision apparently will apply to any vehicle, regardless of fuel efficiency.

Harkin's amendment was problematic to the extent that it limited its focus to US cars.  A better approach would be to pass Diane Feinstein's separate bill, <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.247:">S. 247</a>.  <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=304">I posted last month</a> on her bill which limits the tax credit to fuel efficient vehicles, but also provides a transit benefit for people who don't want to purchase a new car.

It <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20090202/ANA06/902020383/-1">remains unclear</a> how aggressively Feinstein is going to push the Senate to act on her legislation, but there is <a href="http://www.argusleader.com/article/20090126/NEWS/901260303/1001">evidence</a> to <a href="http://blog.nj.com/njv_editorial_page/2009/02/tax_cuts_could_boost_auto_indu.html">suggest</a> that her scheme could have broader support than Harkin's protectionist amendment.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It appears that President Obama is serious about charting a new course for US environmental policy after eight years of neglect by George W. Bush.

On Friday, <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/E9-2890.htm">he issued a memorandum</a> to Secretary of Energy Steven Chu to prioritize the issuing of federal regulations mandating energy efficiency in major appliances and other products.

The only reason the memorandum needed to be issued was because of the Bush administration's failure to follow the law.  Efficiency standards were first mandated by Congress in the 1970s as a way to encourage conservation in the midst of a global energy crisis.  Part of the legislation required that the Department of Energy revisit the regulations periodically to take into account advances in technology.

Before leaving office in 2001, the Clinton Administration began the process of issuing new rules according to statue but Bush nullified them before they were able to go into effect and his Department of Energy failed to issue its own rules.  This prompted <a href="http://doj.state.nh.us/publications/nreleases2004/011304rollback.html">lawsuits</a> from various states and environmental groups, like the National Resources Defense Council.  The legal challenges were ultimately successful and in 2006 the <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/media/pressreleases/061113.asp">DoE finally agreed to a timetable</a> for issuing the regulations.

The Bush Administration was not known for its alacrity in regulating industry and eventually made no moves to institute the regulations.

Obama, with the stroke of a pen, put the new efficiency standards on the fast track urging that DoE to have them finalized by August, 2009.  The <a href="http://www.sciam.com/blog/60-second-science/post.cfm?id=obama-orders-new-energy-standards-f-2009-02-06">standards will result in significant efficiency gains</a> and greenhouse gas emission reductions as new products--such as air conditioners, dishwashers and ovens--will have to become more energy efficient.]]></content:encoded>

Furthermore, Obama has nominated King County, Washington Executive Ron Sims to be the Assistant Secretary at HUD.  Sims has been <a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/exec/news/release/2009/February/11greenhouse.aspx">proactive</a> in Washington in adopting emissions reduction policies and <a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2009/2/3/162210/2967">is generally thought of as innovative</a> when it comes to developing policies advocating sustainable urbanism.]]></content:encoded>

How can we change attitudes like the one expressed by the police officer above? Through advertising campaigns like the ones in the UK and Ireland? We've been talking about this a lot lately, but it's worth bringing it up again: If even police officers like the one quoted above don't think speeding is speeding, how are we ever going to get anywhere in our efforts to slow people down? More from around the network: Hugh Bartling says urbanists are liking new Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan; Discovering Urbanism looks at the appointment of Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carrión as director of the new Office of Urban Affairs; and just for fun, Austin on Two Wheels posts a Miller ad that uses a fun bike ride to sell some beer.

		<title>Canada Pledges $500 million for Toronto&#039;s GO Transit System</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As President Obama was signing the new economic stimulus bill in Denver earlier this week that includes <a href="http://t4america.org/blog/archives/672">$6.9 billion (US) for transit capital projects</a>, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty announced a <a href="http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_32178.aspx">$500 million (Cdn) [$398 million US] investment</a> for a SINGLE transit system as part of their stimulus efforts.

The money is going to the <a href="http://www.gotransit.com/">GO Transit</a> system which operates regional service in the Greater Toronto Area (as opposed to the <a href="http://www3.ttc.ca/">Toronto-dominated TTC</a>).

The comprehensive list of specific projects to be funded has not been announced.  But apparently they are planning to spend about 35% of the total to construct 6,000 parking spaces at GO Transit train stations!

I <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=173">blogged last year</a> about the parking problem at these GO Stations--many of which are sited in low-density sprawlsville.  While it is great that there is high demand for transit in Toronto's suburbs, spending THAT much on expanding parking capacity seems questionable in the long run.

A more integrative approach towards land use might be preferable.  This would entail putting investment in higher density, multi-use development at the forefront of stimulus efforts.  Expanding the sea of parking around these transit stations will likely degrade suburban neighborhoods and problems with congestion will likely persist.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Obama Begins to Stake Ground on Cap-and-Trade Legislation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With Senate Majority Leader <a href="http://uscarbonreport.com/harry-reid-climate-legislation-coming-later-this-year/">Harry Reid predicting</a> that climate change legislation will be considered by Congress sometime this summer, it is never too soon to try and read the tea leaves to see what conflict to expect between Congress and the Presidency.

One major issue in a potential cap-and-trade scheme will involve how emission credits are allocated.  The debate generally focuses on whether credits are simply given to industry or are auctioned.  Industry--as should be obvious--generally prefers not having to pay for emissions credits, arguing that unknown costs inhibit their planning and could trouble consumers.

Proponents of auctions, on the other hand, argue that a more accurate price point for carbon emerges through auctioning and the revenues generated can be used for easing the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Reid (as far as I know) hasn't taken a position on the auction issue; but <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSWBT01070320090223">today Obama's press secretary, Robert Gibbs</a>, seemed to be pushing the need for auctions as a revenue generator.  His statement is a bit cryptic, but he indicates the President would likely support legislation that "allowed us to spend even more money investing in alternative energies."

This is consistent with Obama's plan hashed out in the campaign to use money earned from emissions credit auctions to specifically finance alternative energy research.  This issue of auctioning is going be quite contentious in Congress and the fault line between pro- and anti- auction camps won't likely match party affiliation.

It might be interesting to listen closely to Obama on this front as he goes to Capitol Hill tomorrow to address a joint session of Congress since climate change is supposedly  going to be on his agenda.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Auto Industry Bailout Doomed:  Too Many Cars</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The esteemed urban historian Carl Abbott has an <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/business/automotive/view.bg?articleid=1153456&srvc=business&position=recent">interesting commentary at the Boston Herald website</a> on the viability of the auto industry in the 21st century.

His basic thesis: the growth era for automobile consumption has ended in the US.  He looks at statistics relating to population growth and the growth in automobile consumption.  Like any other commodity, cars went from being a novelty in the early twentieth century to being ubiquitous today.  In 1968, the US had a 100 million cars for 199 million Americans.  In 2006, by contrast, the population of 225 million Americans over the age of 18 was outweighed by an automobile population of 234 million passenger vehicles.

Obviously, people will continue to buy replacement autos as their cars age, but there does seem to be a limit to how many cars the country can consume.

Is the economic downturn simply accelerating the decline of growth rates in the auto industry that are simply unsustainable?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>More Tea-Leaf Reading on US Climate Legislation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Contrary to <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=320">my post yesterday</a> that alluded to the US Senate's "summer" timetable to work on climate legislation, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/feb/24/barackobama-climatechange">the Guardian</a> and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSTRE51M6NO20090224">Reuters</a> are reporting that President Obama is softening his stance on wanting to see legislation passed this year.

White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs apparently was asked directly about the White House's view on a climate bill timeline and indicated they would like to see it "this year or next year."  The Guardian article quotes Washington governor Christine Gregorie as saying Obama stressed the complexity of climate legislation during a meeting yesterday with governors.

It would not be unexpected for Obama and Congress to punt on climate legislation given the economic condition and the impending federal receivership of large banks that they will have to contend with in the next months.  Yet, for a serious global agreement to be hashed out in Copenhagen in December, concrete US action on climate will be invaluable.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>More Details Emerging on Obama&#039;s Cap-and-Trade Position</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The front page of this morning's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/us/politics/26budget.html?ref=todayspaper">New York Times carries a story</a> on Obama's budget, which he is set to make public today.

Of particular interest is his proposed cap-and-trade legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions.  According to the article, auctioning of emissions permits to industry seems to be taken as a given.  A bit more problematic, however, is precisely <em>where</em> he intends to invest the revenues generated from a permit auction.

Fifteen billion dollars will go to fund research into renewable and carbon-neutral energy sources, which is fine.  In order to minimize the burden on lower-income people, however, Obama is proposing giving tax credits ranging from $400-$800.

The problem with these tax credits is that they are not tied to particular efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.   The money offset by the tax credits can be used for any purpose.  A better scheme would link these credits to actual activities that reduce emissions, such as investments in efficiency, installation of residential solar panels, or a public transit subsidy.  Such restricted subsidy could also have a greater economic impact.  People would only get the subsidy if they made energy efficient purchases.

It makes sense to give low-income earners a subsidy given the likelihood of higher energy costs.  But if the purpose of the subsidy is to reduce the burden of these higher costs, it makes sense to give people money that will insure lower energy consumption.]]></content:encoded>

It seems that--despite the rhetoric about "green jobs" and "post carbon economies"--that many of the national stimulus plans are not actively assessing their impact on the criteria of carbon minimization.  When you break down the numbers spending is going primarily to traditional infrastructure projects like roads and construction which will circulate money in the global economy--but will also increase carbon emissions.
The FT has also posted <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f7fb8740-089d-11de-b8b0-0000779fd2ac,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Ff7fb8740-089d-11de-b8b0-0000779fd2ac.html&_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F69dfdef0-081d-11de-8a33-0000779fd2ac.html">a nice interactive graphic</a> comparing the stimulus schemes of various countries.

		<title>Sustainable Food Policy Advances in Illinois</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=328</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The popularity of books like Michael Pollan's <em>Omnivore's Dilemma</em> and Barbara Kingsolver's <em>Animal, Vegetable, Miracle</em> has brought a greater awareness of the problems of industrial agriculture in the United States.  The health, economic, and environmental impact of an industrialized, monocrop food system has caused consumers to change their behavior throughout the country.  Organic foods and farmers markets are expanding as people seek healthy and environmentally friendly food.

The industrial food system, however, is not simply the product of market forces; rather, it is influenced by a complex web of federal subsidies, production habits, and distributional frameworks that are inherently preferential to large producers to the detriment of small farmers.  While consumer changes are significant, they can't mitigate the power of entrenched policies.

Little policy reform has been present at the federal level in the United States, but there are grassroots movements at the state and local level that are trying to affect change.  Illinois is at the forefront of these efforts.  After a year of meetings and consultations involving urban/suburban consumers, environmentalists, farmers, chefs, wholesalers, and social justice advocates, the <a href="http://www.agr.state.il.us/marketing/Mkt_ILOFFTaskForce.html">Illinois Food and Farms Task Force</a> released <a href="http://www.foodfarmsjobs.org/">its report</a> which advocates for a sustainable, local food system in the state.

In a state where 95% of its agricultural products are commodity crops destined for export, the report calls for state agencies to strive to obtain 20% of their food purchases from local sources by 2020.  Institutions that receive state money--like public schools--are encouraged to obtain 10% of their food purchases from local sources by 2020.  The report also calls for the establishment of a State Food Council to explore further strategies to increase the vibrancy of the local food system.

The Illinois General Assembly will be considering <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?GAID=10&GA=96&DocNum=3990&DocTypeID=HB&SessionID=76&LegID=46828&SpecSess=&Session=">HB 3990</a>--which will establish these initial elements of the legislation.  While the legislation will not be heavy on mandates, having a state-sanctioned body of diverse interests looking seriously at the issues of food networks at the state level will undoubtedly bring more attention to the advantages of diversifying rural economies and minimizing the carbon footprint of agriculture in the state.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New York Governor to Gut Cap-and-Trade Scheme</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/06/nyregion/06paterson.html?_r=1&ref=nyregion">New York Times is reporting</a> that Governor David Patterson has caved to electric utilities by weakening the state's carbon trading scheme.

New York is a member of the <a href="http://www.rggi.org/home">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a> (RGGI), which seeks to reduce CO2 emissions from the power sector by a factor of 10% by the year 2018.  The initiative establishes a carbon cap and requires electricity providers to purchase emissions allowances.

My understanding is that each of the states participating in the initiative determine the method of allocating allowances.  The most effective way at determining a price for emissions is by auctioning off the allowances.  Gov. Patterson--after strong lobbying from the utilities industry--has apparently decided to give away nearly $17 million worth of allowances for free.

This is money that would otherwise be used for low-carbon investment.  Patterson's move will also put pressure on other states to give away allowances since the emissions credits are transferable (i.e. if one state gives them away the carbon price is artificially lowered since New York utilities can sell them to utilities in other states for massive profit).

Too many free allocations plagued the effectiveness of the European Union's cap-and-trade scheme during its initial phase.  Patterson seems interested in following that questionable path.

This development is worrisome, as the RGGI is something of a model in the US and will likely influence Congressional deliberations this year on a national cap-and-trade scheme.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Illinois Sustainable Agriculture Bill Passes Key House Committee</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=330</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=325">couple of weeks ago I posted</a> about the introduction of the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=09600HB3990ham001&GA=96&SessionId=76&DocTypeId=HB&LegID=46828&DocNum=3990&GAID=10&Session=">Local Food, Farms, and Jobs Act</a> in the Illinois General Assembly.

The Act will encourage state institutions and organizations receiving state money to purchase food products from producers within Illinois.  It will also establish a Local Food Council comprised of representatives from various sectors of the food system: consumers, farmers, distributors, chefs, and municipal activists.

The idea is to create a sustainable, regional food system which enhances rural and urban economic development, public health, and environmental responsilbility.  Currently, the state's agricultural sector is primarily dedicated to the production of commodity crops like corn and soybeans.  This type of production is capital intensive, dominated by a small number of large corporations, and subject to the volatility of global commodity markets.

Encouraging a locally-focused food system allows a greater diversity of economic opportunities in Illinois' rural communities while simultaneously meeting a market need in the state's urban centers and reducing the environmental impact of agricultural production.

More information about the bill and the movement towards local food security in Illinois can be found at the <a href="http://www.foodfarmsjobs.org/">Illinois Food and Farm Task Force website</a>.
The bill passed the House Agriculture and Conservation Committee last week and will likely be voted on by the entire Illinois House within the next two to three weeks.

<strong>UPDATE</strong>

The bill passed the House yesterday nearly unanimously!  Now it will go to the Senate.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=253">November I posted on a curious</a>--and possibly environmentally devastating--case of neo-colonialism involving Madagascar and the Korean conglomerate, Daewoo. 

The case involved a deal being hatched between the country's leadership and Daewoo whereby the Korean company would lease about half of Madagascar's arable land with the intent of growing export crops for Korean consumption.  As I noted at the time, about 65% of the population in Madagascar was facing chronic food insecurity.  The details of the plan were sketchy, but if the deal went through, likely people in an already tenuous position would be displaced from their land, or forested areas of the country would be converted to commodity cropland causing serious environmental problems.

It appears that the potential deal struck a chord with the political opposition and prompted the street demonstrations that culminated in a military-backed coup last week.  Thus it is noteworthy that the new president, Andry Rajolenia, <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7e133310-13ba-11de-9e32-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1">announced yesterday</a> that the deal is now cancelled.

The political situation in Madagascar remains precarious after the coup, with <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aqiaTCUQ3jwk&refer=home">the US announcing</a> that it was suspending aid.  But it appears--for the time being--that this ill-conceived Korean sell-off is dead.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Hugh, sorry to be off-topic. I'm on hiatus from TPM, but I wanted to let you know that on Friday my office watched a webinar of Christopher B. Leinberger, of Brookings, on "drive-able suburban" versus "walkable urban."

Leindberger started with Futurama at the NY World's Fair, then presented the idea that I Love Lucy, Leave it to Beaver and The Dick van Dyke Show had been important in the growth of the suburbs, mentioning Ricky and Lucy dragging Fred and Ethel out of the city and into the Connecticut suburbs. And more recently, he said, the Millennials had been similarly influenced by Seinfeld, Friends and Sex in the City into wanting to live in walkable urban settings with the sort of active and enjoyable street life seen in those shows.

I think there was more of a back-and-forth of influences, personally. Americans lived in suburbs and Jack Benny and George Burns (1950) and Ozzie Nelson (1952) all had sitcoms placed in the suburbs before Lucy and Ricky moved to the 'burbs. Later I think Millennials who had grown up suburban were ready for a change, though I'm sure that popular media fanned the flames.

It was a very interesting POV about what is driving walkable urbanism. I guess I have another book on my wish list.

		<title>Bonn Climate Change Talks Yield Little Progress</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[During the last week climate negotiators from around the world descended on Bonn to engage in talks leading up December's meeting in Copenhagen which is supposed to result in a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol.

The Bonn meeting was the first major international negotiation attended by US President Barack Obama's new climate team, headed by Todd Stern and Jonathan Pershing.

According <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/world/09climate.html?ref=world">to reports from the meeting</a>, delegates appreciated the engagement by Stern--which contrasted to the recalcitrant position of the Bush Administration.

However, in terms of actual progress towards Copenhagen, the US position is appearing to fall short of Europe.   While the EU has promoted a 30% reduction of greenhouse gases from 1990 levels by 2020, the US simply wants to reach its 1990 levels by the same date.  Both the EU and the US agree on an 80% reduction from 1990 levels by 2050.  <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/weather/climate/globalwarming/2009-04-08-emission-reductions_N.htm">According to USA Today</a>, the US appears to be pushing the idea that the Copenhagen agreement should focus more on 2050 targets--as opposed to 2020.  The problem with this position is that it makes it easy to defer action to the future, which may translate into inaction as political regimes change.

Additionally, the New York Times article seemed to suggest that Obama's team is embracing the Bush position that the US will only agree to binding emissions reductions if China and India do as well.  This position is likely to be a deal-killer for China and India who argue that their per-capita emissions remain low and that for reasons of equity, rich industrialized countries should bear the burden of binding emissions reductions.

The US didn't bring specific numbers on emissions reductions and obligations to the table in Bonn, so it is hard to analyze the full extent of their position.  Later this month, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSTRE52R26O20090328">Obama is convening a meeting</a> of leaders of the world's major economies to discuss climate change.  It will be interesting to watch those proceedings closely since they will undoubtedly influence the next UN-sponsored forum which will once again take place in Bonn at the beginning of June.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Where does Obama Stand on Mountaintop Removal?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On the campaign trail last year, Barack Obama <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/2007/08/27/obama_fires_up_crowd_in_lexing.php">expressed concern</a> about the practice of <a href="http://www.appvoices.org/index.php?/site/mtr_overview/">mountaintop removal</a> in Appalachian coal mining.  Mountaintop removal involves literally tearing off the top of a mountain to gain access to the coal and dumping the waste rock and soil directly into streams and riparian areas.  As one could imagine, the practice is devastating to forests and water quality in the region.

There are regulations that require restoration of damaged land and safe depositing of waste materials, but the Bush Administration <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/washington/03mining.html?_r=1">aggressively used its regulatory power</a> to issue rules that were heavily favorable to industry and severely damaging to the environment.

That is why <a href="http://blogs.wvgazette.com/coaltattoo/2009/04/23/obama-still-learning-toward-insider-for-osmre/">reports that Obama is going to retain</a> a key Bush appointee as head of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement are troubling.  Glenda Owens is the interim head of the agency.  Although she is a career bureaucrat, <a href="http://www.appalachian-center.org/media/2007/07_26.html">she has been criticized for lax enforcement</a> of environmental laws and the agency as a whole has had a record during the Bush years of issuing environmentally-questionable permits to mine operators.

It is still unclear whether or not Obama is going to retain Owens.  After the <a href="http://www.peer.org/news/news_id.php?row_id=1185">Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility put out a press release</a> saying Owens has been tapped to head the agency, the Washington Post reported that the Secretary of the Interior's spokesperson said that she is simply <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/23/AR2009042304115.html?hpid=news-col-blog">"someone who is being considered."</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Major Economies Meeting on Climate Change Wraps Up</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=334</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With all of the talk of an impending flu pandemic, the meeting of high-level ministers from the world's "major economies" has not been given much press.  Perhaps this also may be a result of the fact that nothing path breaking was agreed upon in the meetings that just wrapped up in Washington.

According to the <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/04/122377.htm">official recap</a> released yesteday by the State Department:
<blockquote>There was wide support for <strong>considering</strong> how best the Major Economies Forum can contribute to a successful outcome at the UN climate negotiations in Copenhagen in December. The meeting included active exchanges on this topic, and participants agreed to <strong>continue discussions</strong> on mitigation, finance, adaptation and related issues at their next meeting, including <strong>exploring</strong> shared assumptions. The discussions underscored the need for near term ambitious actions for all, as well as pathways, and the development of mid-term goals for developed countries.

Participants commented on the <strong>potential</strong> for the Major Economies Forum to support the development of transformational technologies critical to mitigating climate change globally.</blockquote>
The highlighted words reflect that little of substance was agreed upon in this US-sponsored parallel session to the ongoing United Nations talks.  When Bush conceived of these talks a year ago, it was not clear what was going to be accomplished.  <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=172">Skepticism of Bush's intentions</a> tempered enthusiasm.

With the US rhetoric on climate change shifting under Obama, at least a spirit of participation and pragmatism has been developed.  Yet, major gaps remain between the positions of the US, the EU, and emerging economies.

The <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/environment/global-warming/emissions-agreement-comes-a-step-closer-20090429-anft.html">Sydney Morning Herald reports</a> that the EU is frustrated with US and Australian foot dragging on agreeing to an adequate medium term (2020) level of greenhouse gas reduction.

The <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-04/29/content_7727980.htm">Chinese envoy was disappointed</a> that the issue of transferring green technologies to developing economies was not even discussed--which is interesting since technology transfer is a major component of the ongoing UN talks.

<a href="http://blogs.ft.com/energy-source/2009/04/29/developing-countries-and-the-climate-negotiations/">Fiona Harvey of the Financial Times suggests</a> this omission may reflect a major sticking point between China & India and the US.  Namely, the issue of how to address rapidly rising developing country emissions.  Although China recently surpassed the US as the largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions, their per-capita levels are minuscule.  Thus, asking developing countries to make reductions (as Bush demanded) is unreasonable and inequitable.  What is on the table, Harvey reports, is asking developing countries to curb their GHG growth rather than engage in absolute cuts.

<a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/04/rise_green_dragon.html">Andrew Light and Nina Hachigan at the Center for American Progress</a> have a good post saying that China is giving signals that they are willing to negotiate on this point.

This latter issue will be interesting to watch as leaders from the major economies convene in Italy in July.  If an agreeable arrangement between China and the US can be worked out prior to Copenhagen, there will be significant momentum for the UN meetings to result in a meaningful agreement.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today's <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-trashed-townhouses-w-zone-01may01,0,3224239.story">Chicago Tribune has an article</a> discussing the problems facing residents of a new planned community in Oswego, Illinois--a growing suburb on the exurban fringe of Chicago.I am sure the story is not unique given the severity of the foreclosure crisis and the lack of regional planning that provides incentives for over-development in fast-growing suburbs like Oswego.

The story goes something like this: developer acquires former farmland and gets it zoned for redevelopment, acquires financing based on the assumption that the loan will be repaid with receipts from early sales, establishes homeowners association to fund the maintenance of common areas relieving the municipality from that burden, markets the new development as a <a href="http://www.lakeshoreunits.com/southbury.asp">"place where community thrives,"</a> gets a few buyers but ultimately abandons the site because of lack of sales, leaves the residents with a mess of half-completed buildings and the bill for cleanup.

This seems to be a real hazard of master-planned developments in the midst of a real estate collapse.  I don't know if this is the case with Oswego, but exurban municipalities often count on developers to provide basic public amenities as a condition for the approval of projects.  One of the complaints of residents cited in the article was that promotional materials from the developer indicated that parks, recreational facilities, and a community center were supposed to have been built.  To finance those amenities apparently the developer was counting on revenues from early sales.  When the developer abandoned the project, none of the amenities had been built.

Municipalities are in a tough position.  It is in their interest to approve development which will raise tax revenue and to do it in a way which will minimize costs for the provision of public services.  Costs of normal amenities are borne by the developer and the residents who directly benefit.  However, outsourcing this activity to the market can result in these types of unintended consequences which could actually increase costs to the municipality in the long run:  half-finished developments become eyesores and they could likely reduce property values in adjacent neighborhood.

Once the real estate market rebounds, it will be interesting to see if suburbs demand certain concessions from developers to stave off this type of problem.  It is probably unlikely in the absence of regional planning since suburban municipalities will likely still be competing for developer investment and find it hard to resist their demands.  There are ways that states and the federal government can provide incentives for more coherent regimes of planning on the part of municipalities--but I'll have to leave that subject for another post!

In the meantime, if anyone has examples similar to what's going on in Oswego, please send them along!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/may/06/china-seeks-climate-change-deal">Guardian reports</a> that British climate secretary Ed Miliband believes that China is willing to negotiate on the issue of emissions targets given the change in the US position under Barack Obama.

China's position has been that, given the fact that they have such low per-capita emissions, the developed world should bear the burden of absolute reductions.  This was always a deal-breaker for Bush who didn't accept the equity argument of the Chinese.

Miliband--who just finished a series of meetings in Beijing--believes that Obama's flexible stance on the issue has prompted China to perhaps agree to emissions intensity targets as part of an agreement coming out of December's UN-sponsored talks in Copenhagen.

"Emissions intensity" refer to the amount of emissions needed to produce a unit of economic growth.  Under this scenario, China may agree to reduce their emissions intensity as opposed to actual number of total emissions.  This would go a long way towards giving Obama political cover at home where Republican critics of climate change negotiations keep on bringing up Chinese inaction as reason to oppose US emissions targets.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UN Releases Post-Kyoto Negotiating Documents</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=337</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Important negotiating documents for the successor to the Kyoto Protocol were released by the United Nations yesterday in advance of negotiating sessions scheduled for early June in Bonn.  The documents are compilations of suggestions by various countries seeking to shape the international treaty expected to emerge out of the major negotiations in Copenhagen later this year.

It is interesting to see how these documents evolve during the months leading up to Copenhagen as they give the first concrete sense of many countries' negotiating positions.

Two documents were released yesterday.  <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/awg8/eng/07.pdf">One focuses on national commitments</a> [.pdf] to greenhouse gas emissions reductions beginning in 2013.  <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/awg8/eng/08.pdf">The second proposes systematic</a> ways of incorporating land use into the Kyoto successor.

I haven't had a chance to read through the land use document, but the national commitment document is quite interesting.  One of the sticking points at Kyoto was coming to an agreement as to which countries would have to reduce their emissions and by how much.  With the Kyoto commitment period ending in 2012, this document essentially picks up where the discussions in Kyoto left off, with an eye for developing second commitment period targets.

There are several options being floated, with only one offering explicit country-by-country reduction numbers for the second commitment period.  Most of the proposals simply put forward a time line for the next commitment period and an indication of which countries should be covered.  One of the main issues that recalcitrant nations like the US had with Kyoto was the exclusion of developing countries, like China and India, from having binding targets.  Most of the proposals keep the distinction between the "developed" (termed "Annex I" under the Kyoto Protocol) and "less developed" countries.

Several, however, break down that distinction, suggesting that some countries may push for commitments from all signatories.  This does not mean that all countries will have mandatory emissions reductions as Kyoto, for instance, set a precedence whereby some Annex I countries had obligations that exceeded their 1990 emissions.

The document also had some negotiating points on general, global emissions reduction targets. These included proposals to requiring Annex I parties to reduce emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2018 or 45% by 2020.

Finally, there was some mention of taking into account per-capita emissions levels.  It will be interesting to see where this goes, given that the developing world (headed by China, Brazil, India, and others) argue that they should not be required to have any binding emissions reductions given the fact that per capita emissions are so small.  It is the developed world that has the large per capita carbon footprint and should, hence, be most responsible for cutting emissions.

From the standpoint of the US, it is noteworthy that Obama's target of reducing US emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 is much weaker than most of the proposals contained in these negotiating texts.

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/15/AR2009051501297.html">Reuters reports</a> that the UN will be releasing another negotiating document in a number of days that looks to set forth long term (i.e. 2050) reduction commitments.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Secret US-China Climate Deal?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm surprised this hasn't been picked up in the US press, but <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/18/secret-us-china-emissions-talks">the Guardian is reporting</a> that a bipartisan group of US functionaries held several meetings in the second half of 2008 with China's top climate negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, to find common ground between the two countries.

The meetings apparently started in July and continued following the election of Barack Obama to the US Presidency.  Many of the Democratic representatives were high level Congressional staffers or former Clinton officials who now have positions in the Obama administration.  These include current White House science adviser John Holdren, Joe Biden's adviser Jim Green, and long-time Democratic State Department hand, Frank Loy.

According to the Guardian, the group proposed that the two countries agree  to reduce emissions by 20% by 2010, cooperate on technological development of carbon capture and storage, and to commit to a global agreement in Copenhagen.  Apparently these terms were looked upon favorably by Xie.

While there has been no publicized agreement between the two countries, Hilary Clinton did announce a "clean energy partnership" with China during her visit there earlier this year.

This dialogue can only represent a positive move for an international climate agreement to be hatched in Copenhagen later this year.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Obama Endorses Regulations to Enhance Auto Fuel Economy and Emissions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[US President <a href="http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13685976">Barack Obama's announcement yesterday</a> that he plans to increase the fuel efficiency standard for automobiles and regulate their tailpipe emissions is quite significant.

After eight years of federal government inaction, Obama was able to get state goverenments, the auto industry, and environmentalists to agree on a plan that will limit greenhouse gas emissions, (perhaps) enhance the competitiveness of the beleaguered US auto industry, and reduce petrol consumption.

One of the things I found remarkable was the swiftness with which the auto makers abandoned their long-standing opposition to increasing the fuel efficiency standard.  Ever since California requested from the Bush administration a waiver to establish their own emissions standards under the Clean Air Act, the auto industry balked at how difficult it would be to follow a "patchwork" of different state standards.  They never had a reasonable response to the retort that they should simply adopt the more stringent, California standards on a nationwide basis.

Yesterday, however, the major auto executives stood behind Obama and praised the new regulations.  Whether this is a result of the industry coming to terms with the prospects of a dismal future or an example of Obama's power of persuasion is uncertain.  Regardless, this is a significant development.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Preview of Bonn Climate Talks</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=340</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Beginning on <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/sb30/items/4842.php">Monday in Bonn,</a> the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is holding a new round of negotiations.  The goal is to get more clarity on an international agreement prior to the year-end talks in Copenhagen.

A couple weeks ago <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=334">I posted</a> on the document that is being discussed relating to possible changes in obligations from developed countries.  The topic of this post is <a href="http://unfccc.int/documentation/documents/advanced_search/items/3594.php?rec=j&priref=600005243#beg">the document being discussed</a> by the Ad-hoc Working Group on Long Term Cooperative Action.

This document is laying the groundwork for what the long-term limits should be for greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere as well as how mitigation and adaptation should be financed and verified in various contexts.

There are several propositions in the document for long term limit goals.   The options under discussion range from stabilizing GHG concentration in the atmosphere at 450 ppm all the way to 350 ppm.  Each number would be a significant goal.  The current concentration is around <a href="http://www.350.org/understanding-350">388 ppm</a> and scientific models suggest that the <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/009899.html">number could more than double</a> in the absence of a significant global mitigation effort.

On the issue of mitigation the document has a wide range of time lines and emissions reduction numbers.   One provision asks developed countries to decrease GHG emissions between 20-45 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 and by anywhere from 75-90 percent of 1990 levels by 2050.

As a point of comparison: Obama has pledged to reduce US emissions down to 1990 levels by 2020 and then hit the 80% target by 2050.  The Waxman-Markey bill is even weaker, calling for an 83% reduction from 2005 levels by 2050.

Also included in the document were targets for developing countries, including a reduction from "business as usual" between 15-30% by 2020 and an eventual 20% reduction from 2000 levels by 2050.  Large developing countries like China have <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hLcZ2jQ4mu4rd7XlB3hetiVn1qbAD98FBCCG0">shown signs in recent days</a> a willingness to deviate from business as usual; but any net emissions reduction obligations will likely be a non-starter.

It will be interesting to see how the various disparities get hashed out over the next two weeks in Bonn.  This is really the first time we are starting to see actual numbers in the negotiation documents.  Optimism is relatively high given the change in US administrations and the opening of a China-US dialog on the subject in recent months.  How delegates from various countries react to the actual numbers in Bonn could give a sense of whether this optimism is nothing more than a chimera.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Japan on the Hot Seat at Bonn Climate Change Talks</title>

UN-sponsored climate change talks began on Monday in Bonn.  The negotiations will last two weeks and represent a step on the path towards a successor to the Kyoto agreement scheduled to be completed by December.

While the negotiations are underway many NGOs are highlighting the domestic positions of various countries.  Yesterday, the Climate Action Network held a <a href="http://unfccc2.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/090601_SB30_Bonn/templ/ply_page.php?id_kongresssession=1744&player_mode=isdn_real">press conference</a> to discuss the impending decision on levels of greenhouse gas emission reductions in Japan.

Prime Minister Taro Aso indicated that he would announce Japan's midterm (2020) reduction target sometime in the next couple of weeks.  The graphic above illustrates the various targets being debated in Japan--<a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/T207755.htm">everything ranging from</a> a 4% increase from 1990 levels to a 25% decrease.

Japan's decision will undoubtedly influence where other big emitters set their own targets--particularly the United States.  <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/T207755.htm" />

<a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/T207755.htm">Today a major Japanese business group suggested</a> that domestic industry could meet a 15% reduction.  Last month, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/feedarticle/8531793">Aso said</a> that a 25% reduction would be hard to sell politically in the country given the recession.  During the CAN press conference, Masako Konishi of WWF-Japan, however, cited a recent public opinion poll that suggested there was strong public support for significant reduction targets.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US Climate Envoy: China Needs Emissions Commitments</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tomorrow US State Department climate change negotiator Todd Stern will head to Bonn to join the UN-sponsored climate change talks.  The Bonn meeting is seen as a key step towards the goal of coming to an international agreement at Copenhagen in December.

On Wednesday <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/events/2009/06/china.html">Stern gave an address</a> at the Center for American Politics that focused on China and the US-China relationship on the issue of climate change.  During the Bush administration, the US essentially maintained that no global climate change agreement would be possible without China agreeing to significant emissions cuts.  This position has basically been a non-starter with China given the fact that industrialized countries are responsible for the <a href="http://www.pewclimate.org/facts-and-figures/international/cumulative">highest percentage of cumulative emissions</a> and their current per capita levels of emissions outweigh those of developing countries such as China.<img width="307" height="240" align="right" src="http://www.state.gov/img/09/30629/clinton-stern_600_1.jpg" />

How the Obama administration is going to address the China issue, therefore, has been a matter of interest.

From Stern's talk it is clear that the US is not going to demand absolute cuts from China.  However, he pretty forcefully said that China can't hide behind its old arguments, arguing that it is not in China's interest to pursue a high-carbon form of development.

He was asked by reporter to clarify specific actions the US might be looking for from China and responded that whatever it is, it must be substantive and verifiable.  To me this suggests that maybe there is some commitment on the table whereby China would reduce energy intensity or hit an emissions target below business-as-usual projections.

We probably won't get too much clarification in the short term, but it is likely that there will be significant behind the scenes discussions in Bonn between Stern and his Chinese counterparts about ways to move forward.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Sprawl Dead in Jersey?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[According to the <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.com/article/20090607/COMMUNITIES/906070310/1005/NEWS01">Morris County New Jersey <em>Daily Record</em></a>, regional planning efforts in the northwest part of the state have resulted in "stopping sprawl."  The article cites the fact that no new large subdivisions were constructed in the county as evidence of sprawl's demise.

While the economic downturn, depressed housing prices, and the credit crunch may also have had something to do with halting development, the article emphasizes the power of a 2004 state legislative initiative-- <a href="http://www.highlands.state.nj.us/">The Highlands Act</a>--as being the primary reason.

The Act was established to protect open space and water quality in northern New Jersey.  My understanding is that the seven counties and over 80 municipalities that are located in the Highlands area have to insure that their plans are in compliance with the regional Highlands Plan.  Additionally, the Plan is governed by a regional council that has veto power over large development decisions.

This type of regional decision making power is essential to minimize the negative consequences that accompany the typical fragmented land use decisions seen elsewhere in North America.  If it seems like the Highlands Plan is really influencing the trajectory of development in northwestern New Jersey, it might be a useful model for other states to follow in order to bring some coherence to metropolitan development.

Normally, governors or state officials who recommend regional planning with teeth meet significant levels of resistance from legislatures and municipalities.  The Highlands Act seems to have been an exception.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Following my <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=340">post last night</a> on New Jersey's Highlands Act and the impact it is having on growth in northwest New Jersey, I came across a new report published by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy entitled <a href="http://www.lincolninst.edu/pubs/smart-growth-policies.aspx">Smart Growth Policies: An Evaluation of of Programs and Outcomes</a>.

I look forward to reading the entire book, but with Jersey on my mind, I skimmed through the chapter dedicated to the Garden State.  The chapter's focus is more on state-wide initiatives, but the authors did observe that recent years have seen higher rates of growth in the state's northeastern core counties in comparison to the exurban Highlands region.

Whether this is due to state planning initiatives or to other forces (such as market demand) is not clear, but the trend towards infill--rather than greenfield--development is encouraging.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left">The head of the UN climate change secretariat, Yvo de Boer, <a href="http://unfccc2.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/090601_SB30_Bonn/templ/ply_page.php?id_kongresssession=1800&player_mode=isdn_real">held a press conference yesterday</a> to mark the halfway point of the Bonn talks.   The meetings in Bonn are meant to make progress on a final global climate change agreement due to be signed in Copenhagen in December.</p>
de Boer summed up the four points of "clarity" that he thinks are prerequisites for a final agreement:

<meta content="text/html; charset=utf-8" http-equiv="CONTENT-TYPE" /><title /><meta content="OpenOffice.org 2.0  (Linux)" name="GENERATOR" /><meta content="20090608;22112800" name="CREATED" /><meta content="16010101;0" name="CHANGED" /> 	 	 	 	 	<style type="text/css"> 	<!-- 		@page { size: 8.5in 11in; margin: 0.79in } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.08in } 	--> 	</style>
<ul>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Clarity on individual greenhouse gas emission reduction 	targets for industrialized countries</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Clarity on what large developing 	countries (like China and India) will do to minimize the growth of their emissions</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Clarity on financial support for 	developing countries on adaptation and mitigation</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">A governance structure for adaptation and mitigation aid that gives 	developing countries a voice in how money is spent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
It's hard to disagree with de Boer's analysis.  At this point there is little clarity on any of these points, but perhaps as the week progresses some broad contours will be revealed.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/business/energy-environment/01farm.html?_r=1&em">New York Times had an article</a> on a relatively new trend in suburban housing.  Instead of a housing subdivision displacing agricultural land, there are efforts throughout the United States to integrate small-scale agriculture into the planned residential environment.</p>
<p>These small farms are thought of by developers as a marketable amenity--much like the traditional golf courses or recreational areas used to provide added value to residential development.  They tend to be organic farms and speak to the growing consumer interest in healthy food choices.<br />
Here in the Chicago area, <a href="http://www.prairiecrossing.com/pc/site/index.html">Prairie Crossing</a>, is an early example of the genre.  Calling itself a "conservation community," the subdivision is about 10 years old and contains 350 single family homes and a smattering of condos.  The neighborhoods are surrounded by a restored prairie ecosystem and the community has an organic farm on its outskirts which hosts a weekly farmer's market and a CSA.</p>
<p>For me, the trend is interesting since it speaks to the emergence of a popular sensibility that embraces an environmental ethic.  How these places integrate into larger economic and regional planning systems is another story.  The New York Times article is not clear about the actual siting of these new farming subdivisions, but they are likely built on undeveloped land with little integration into regional networks of commuting and commerce.</p>
<p>Prairie Crossing is one of the few communities of this sort that has public transportation access--although the stations are not wholly integrated into the subdivision's residential districts.  Others likely contribute to exurban sprawl since the new residents will likely have to drive significant distances for work and shopping opportunities.</p>
<p>An organic farm as an amenity may be a better alternative than a golf course, but it won't necessarily support sustainable metropolitan development in the absence of regional planning.</p>
<p>For more information on Prairie Crossing, take a look at the illustrated google maps mashup I put together last year:</p>

It appears the sticking point is that developing countries--in particular, China--are pushing for strong mid-term (2020) targets, something that Japan, Canada, Russia and the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&sid=a8Nn0ucmecE0">US</a> don't appear able to embrace.

		<title>G-8 Declaration Released; Hedges on Climate Change</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Via <a href="http://twitter.com/jschmidtnrdc/status/2537764398">Jake Schmidt at NRDC</a>, the <a href="http://bit.ly/aCNIo">declaration [.pdf]</a> from the G-8 meeting has been released.

Significantly, the G-8 leaders (US, Canada, UK, France, Italy, Russia, Germany, Japan) agree that the global average temperature should not exceed <em><em>2</em>° </em>from pre-industrial levels and that there should be a 50% global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  Furthermore, developed countries should reduce their emissions "in aggregate by 80% or more by 2050 compared to 1990 or more recent years."  The G8 countries also pledge to "undertake robust aggregate and individual mid-term reductions, taking into account that baselines may vary."

On the one hand, it is good to see that a <em><em>2</em>° </em>warming limit should be achieved.  However, without explicit mid-term (2020) reduction targets, it is unclear how exactly the world will get to that level.  The science tells us that immediate action needs to be taken on reductions to stabilize the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and the economics tells us that it will be cheaper to take these actions in the near term.

The fact that there was such wiggle room in the base year for measuring reductions is troubling.  The US and Japan have been obfuscating the extent of their commitment by using more recent years as their base--as opposed to the 1990 levels that are the base years for the Kyoto Protocol.  Thus, the Waxman-Markey Bill promises a "17% reduction" in emissions by 2020 using 2005 as the base year.  In reality, the reduction only gets the US to 4% of the 1990 levels--lower than our negotiated obligations under Kyoto.

Tomorrow the G-8 leaders will be joined by representatives of the "Major Economies"--most notably developing countries such as China, Mexico, India, and South Africa.  <a href="http://hughbartling.com/blog/?p=344">As I posted earlier</a>, these countries are not likely to embrace the current G-8 language without developed country mid-term targets.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Major Economies Forum Ends with Weak Climate Declaration</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The United States-led "Major Economies Forum" met today on the sidelines of the G-8 summit to discuss progress towards a global climate change deal scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.  The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jul/09/climate-change-g8">Guardian has published</a> a draft declaration from the meeting.

The major accomplishment was a recognition that average global temperature needs to be stabilized at 2 degrees centigrade by 2050.  How the world is going to get there is still unresolved.

Particularly disappointing was the absence of an agreement on specific reduction targets to be met in the mid-term (by 2020).  Major developed country emitters, the US, Canada and Japan have been unwilling to make any mid-term commitments, preferring to shift focus to 2050.

Developing countries--whose emissions levels are rising significantly--argue that the historic big emitters need to take steps immediately before they will agree to any of their own reduction targets.

This is one of the key issues to be worked out before a global deal can be reached.  Unfortunately, there is little time.  A more vigorous agreement would have pushed the UN negotiations forward.  As it stands now, low-level negotiators will meet next month in Bonn to continue talks.  In the autumn, UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon is <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31421&Cr=climate+change&Cr1=">convening a meeting</a> of world leaders prior to the opening of the General Assembly.  If the stalemate between the US bloc and developing countries is not broken by then, the prospects for an effective agreement to come out of Copenhagen will begin to recede.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A couple of years ago I published <a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a768593178&fulltext=713240928">some</a> <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iqQyf4KxQfkC&lpg=PA177&ots=_RN_q7krXS&dq=bartling%20tourism%20geographies&pg=PA165">research</a> on a massive planned, retirement community located about 80 miles west of Orlando called <a href="http://www.thevillages.com/">"The Villages."</a>

I was interested in the question of suburban planning by private entities and the somewhat tenuous relationships between private developers, governmental officials, and residents.

One part of this nexus in Florida is a state-sanctioned giveaway to developers through the establishment of "Community Development Districts."  Technically, these CDDs are public governments--like a city--which can perform certain municipal services and raise financing through tax-free bonds.  Developers seek to establish CDDs at the early stages of a community's construction and use their municipal authority to raise money through bonds for infrastructure.

The bonds are serviceable over the long-term, making future homeowners liable for the debt.  CDDs are liked by developers since they don't have to outlay all of the initial infrastructure costs.  Homeowners pay the costs through assessments after they buy the property from the developer.

One of the problems with the system is that it can be easily abused.  During the early years debt obligations can be racked up while the CDD is controlled by the developer. In the case of The Villages, one of the things I pointed out was that the CDD paid significant sums of money for "improved properties" that were owned by the developer and that there was some criticism that the CDD paid well over the market rate.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/us/10florida.html">The New York Times today has an article</a> discussing an IRS investigation into this very issue.  It is hard to get the actual legal angle from the article, but it appears that the IRS is saying that the CDD should have paid taxes on some bonds issued by a Villages CDD since the transaction was essentially benefiting the private developer.

I haven't seen large studies of CDD financing, but I would guess that what was going on in The Villages is not unusual in other large developments in Florida.   If the IRS wins this battle, it could have a significant impact on how developers use this fiancing scheme.  Ironic, however, is the fact that any CDD found liable for back taxes is likely no longer controlled by the developer, but by the residents.  Thus, the CDD would have to increase its assessments on current property owners to satisfy their liability!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A day after G-8 leaders signed a declaration saying that the developed countries of the world had an obligation to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 1990 levels by 2050, the <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/business/fp/Canada+snubs+emissions+target/1776109/story.html">Canadian Environment Minister said</a> that an 80% reduction would not be "practical" for his country.

Their 2050 commitment is a reduction between 60%-70% of 1990 levels.

With Bush off the scene, it appears that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is assuming the position of most recalcitrant world leader on climate change.  This comes on the heels of <a href="http://www.canada.com/news/national/Harper+criticized+snubbing+alternative+energy+group/1779513/story.html">his refusal to join</a> a new <a href="http://www.irena.org/">international organization</a> designed to promote renewable energy strateiges and cooperation worldwide.]]></content:encoded>

He said that they will not "fail," but that more legwork will need to be done at next year's UN meeting.

The context of Pershing's remarks is not clear from the news reports, but any delay in forging a comprehensive global climate agreement will be not only expensive, but hazardous.

The Platts report did quote Pershing as saying a Congressional passage of the cap-and-trade bill will improve Copenhagen's prospects, so perhaps he is trying to push Senate action.  The Senate is scheduled to vote on their version of the House bill in September.

On a more positive note, Brazilian president Lula da Silva, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-GreenBusiness/idUSTRE56C44620090713">expressed confidence</a> yesterday that Copenhagen will produce an agreement.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UK Divulges Low-Carbon Transition Policy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[UK climate minister, Ed Miliband, released the <a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/publications/lc_trans_plan/lc_trans_plan.aspx">UK Low Carbon Transition Plan</a> today.

I haven't had a chance to read it in its entirety, but the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jul/15/government-low-carbon-plans">Guardian has a good rundown</a> of its proposals.

The main goal is to reach a midterm (2020) target of a 34% reduction below 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions.  Half of the reductions are to take place in the electricity sector, which will mean that 40% of power will be generated in a low-carbon fashion (which includes nuclear).

Other tools used to reach the goal will be to increase energy efficiency in buildings and strive to have at least 1.5 million households produce energy.

Also given significant focus is the transportation sector, which is scheduled to cut its emissions by 14% through various policies.   One component that stuck me as interesting is a proposed $47 million competition for a "Sustainable Travel City" which would fund improvements in a British metropolitan area to serve as a national showpiece.   Putting significant money behind a best-practices model could spur other cities to emulate successful low-carbon transport policies.

This type of mid-term commitment will give the UK influence at the Copenhagen talks later this year--particularly given the slow and relatively unambitious efforts going on in Washington.  There is a lot that leaders in other developed countries can learn from this plan--particularly the US Senate as it deliberates over the American Clean Energy and Security Act.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Chu in China</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[US Energy Secretary Stephen Chu was in China yesterday to discuss climate change with governmental officials.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/world/asia/16warming.html?_r=1&ref=world">The New York Times reports</a> that he raised the rhetoric somewhat in the persistent disagreement between the two countries on how the world should respond to climate change.

According to the Times, Chu emphasized that China and other developing nations could make the problem of climate change <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124765079177444337.html">"much worse"</a> with their emissions while acknowledging the West's historical role.  He also presented a set of <a href="http://www.energy.gov/news2009/documents2009/Tsinghua_Slideshow_final_for_distribution.pdf">powerpoint slides [.pdf]</a> emphasizing all the problems that can befall China in the absence of any action on climate change

Chu was accompanied by Commerce Secretary Gary Locke who took a similar theme.  In a speech to business leaders, Locke said: “Fifty years from now, we do not want the world to lay the blame for environmental catastrophe at the feet of China.”

China's position is that their per-capita emissions are quite small, they have not emitted nearly as much historically as the West and that the persistence of "old" greenhouse gases is part of the current problem, and that the West is better equipped financially to make large reductions.

Thus, having Chu and Locke lecture the Chinese on their own emissions is unlikely going to be received well.

The two countries <a href="http://www.energy.gov/news2009/7642.htm">did agree</a> on some partnership programs to increase efficiency and develop clean energy technology.

It's difficult to speculate on the effect that these types of speeches will have on international negotiations, but more positive dialogue coming from US and China officials would make for a more optimistic outcome in Copenhagen later this year.

It should be noted that Chu told a group of reporters after meeting with Chinese officials that <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aobOWRQQQqtU">he feels optimistic</a> about Copenhagen.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Forbes Writer Contemplates $20 Gallon Petrol</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=355</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/07/15/big-box-revenge-business-energy-oil.html">Forbes has posted</a> an excerpt of a new book by one of its writers, Christopher Steiner.  The excerpt from <a href="http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/books_9780446549547.htm">$20 Per Gallon: How the Inevitable Rise in the Price of Gasoline Will Change Our Lives For the Better</a>, seems to retread ground covered by the peak oil crowd a couple of years back.

Nevertheless, it is always interesting to remember the likely impact that will accompany the inevitable rise in petrol prices.  Steiner's excerpt takes aim at the Big Box retailers and--not surprisingly--thinks the prospects for such retailers as Wal-Mart, Target, Home Depot, etc... are dim.

The reasons he highlights are important. First, there is the problem of where the big boxes are located--low density suburban areas that are only accessible  by automobile.  With petrol at $20 gallon, the volume of traffic that these places count on for customers will diminish.

The second reason he cites is the vast global transport network that undergirds the products that are stocked in the stores.  Raw materials from the other side of the planet are moved to factories in other countries similarly far away.  Commodities are assembled in places like China and then shipped to massive distribution centers in the US where the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_(business)">"just-in-time"</a> stocking system insures that goods move in and out of the store quickly.

This whole system of distribution, manufacture and consumption is fossil-fuel intensive making its sustainability, according to Steiner, questionable.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Clinton Gets an Earful on Emissions Reduction in India</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with Indian officials over the weekend to discuss a number of issues, including climate change.  India--along with China--is one of the main developing countries insisting that the United States and the developed world get its low-carbon economy in order before asking developing countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

While it was not likely that Clinton would announce a breakthrough agreement with India during her trip, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/world/asia/20diplo.html?_r=1&ref=global-home">US press is reporting</a> that the US delegation was struck by the forcefulness of India's position. Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh said that there is "no case" for requiring emissions reductions from India.

India believes that it has a strong moral argument given the fact that <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/environmentalcapital/2009/07/20/india-dont-look-to-us-for-emissions-reductions/">its per-capita emissions are extremely low</a> and that the West is historically responsible for the problem.  After this month's Major Economies Forum in Italy where Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh endorsed a document stating that global temperatures should be capped at 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels,<a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/NEWS-India-Negotiators-slam-Indias-climate-flip-at-Italy-forum/articleshow/4782193.cms"> one of his own negotiators blasted Singh</a>, arguing that the international community will inevitably point to the agreement to demand emissions reductions.

Given the internal strife in India over the issue, Ramesh's comments could be seen as an effort to placate domestic dissenters.  <a href="http://www.ptinews.com/news/184036_Hillary-for--creative-solution--to-climate-change-rift">Clinton herself tried to put a positive spin</a> on the meetings, indicating that the discussions in general were "fruitful."

These types of internal disputes should not be discounted--especially in the case of India where the argument that any <a href="http://www.ptinews.com/news/184036_Hillary-for--creative-solution--to-climate-change-rift">binding emissions reductions on their part are inequitable</a> runs deep.

Obama clearly sees India as a major player on a number of issues, including climate.  One positive that came out of Clinton's trip was <a href="http://www.ptinews.com/news/184670_Obama-invites-PM-to-be-1st-state-guest-of-his-Admn-on-Nov-24">the scheduling of a visit to the US by Prime Minister Singh</a> on November 22--two weeks before the international climate change negotiations get under way in Copenhagen.  It will be the first state visit of the Obama Administration.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Problems With European Emissions Trading Scheme</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=357</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The British climate change campaigners, <a href="http://www.sandbag.org.uk/">Sandbag</a>, released a <a href="http://www.sandbag.org.uk/node/172">report</a> yesterday critical of the European cap-and-trade scheme.

The problem is relatively straightforward: too many emissions permits were allocated during the early phase of the scheme.  A surplus of permits, coupled with the global recession, the ability to hoard permits for future years, and the ability for European polluters to fulfill obligations by purchasing cheap offsets in the developing world, has Sandbag speculating that many big emitters won't actually be forced to reduce their own emissions until 2015.

The Sandbag report hasn't dissuaded the British government from continuing to support cap-and-trade.  Just yesterday, Labour MP Mark Lazarowicz <a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/change_energy/tackling_clima/emissions/emissions.aspx">released a report</a> calling for expanding the cap-and-trade model globally.

In the US, I won't be surprised to see climate skeptics reference the Sandbag report as the US Senate <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2009/07/21/21climatewire-senate-democrats-prep-team-girds-for-climate-93361.html">starts to debate its own cap-and-trade bill</a> in the next few weeks.  The problem, however, isn't so much that there is an inherent problem with a cap-and-trade--rather, as the Sandbag report discloses, the problem is in not having a serious emissions cap and relying upon too many loopholes that can militate against significant reductions.

Unfortunately the House version of the cap-and-trade bill is chock full of these loopholes--the most egregious being that most of the permits will be given away to polluters, thus reducing the incentives for action.  Given the fact that the Senate requires 60 votes to defeat a filibuster, it is likely that any legislation they pass will be even MORE watered-down than Waxman-Markey.  Such a scenario does not bode well for the effectiveness of cap-and-trade.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Indian Environment Minister--Climate Denier or Savvy Negotiator?</title>

According to a <a href="http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=50837">press release from</a> the Indian government Ramesh "said we have to get out of the preconceived notion which is based on western media" that retreating glaciers are due to climate change.  He also stressed the scientific uncertainty about the causes of glacial decline in the Himalayas.

Of course there is "scientific uncertainty"--the whole project of science is based on uncertainty.  The real issue is how we use the knowledge gained from science to assess risk and develop policy accordingly.

This is why Ramesh's remarks may be more accurately interpreted as a political move to deflect pressure from Western countries (and the US in particular) that India agree to greenhouse gas emissions cuts at this year's UN negotiations in Copenhagen.

A look at the Indian press shows that Ramesh's understanding of glacial science may be more complicated.  <a href="http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/002200907201877.htmd">The Hindu reports</a> on Ramesh acknowledging a .5 degree rise in India's temperatures over the past century and the <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/NEWS-India-Himalayan-glaciers-have-shrunk-by-38-in-40-years/articleshow/4793466.cms">Times of India</a> indicates that the government is supporting long-term research on glacial change in the Himalayas.

There are other indications that India is taking measures to deal with the problems with a carbon-dominated economy.  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8166415.stm">In Calcutta, a transport strike is underway</a> after West Bengal proposed to ban commercial vehicles older than 15 years from operating on the city's streets.  The main reason for the ban is to try and solve the horrible air pollution problem.

Although the ban in Calcutta is unrelated to Ramesh's position, there is a demonstrated concern--however contentious--that environmental problems need to be solved in this rapidly growing industrial economy.  Perhaps using emissions reductions strategies as a justification for helping to deal with public health could change the dynamic of India's position in international negotiations.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Historic Japanese Election Significant for Climate Agreement</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=372</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2009 19:04:12 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.dpj.or.jp">Democratic Party of Japan's</a> rout of the long-dominant Liberal Democrats in this weekend's election <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gxhl2ApXkhYWtkeQYFE68F5Viwvw">could likely have significance</a> for December's UN-sponsored climate change talks in Copenhagen.

There are many fissures amongst the negotiating positions of the 190-odd countries involved in hashing out a post-Kyoto treaty to decrease global carbon emissions.  But one of the more significant has been the differences amongst developed countries.  The European Union has advocated for strong emissions reductions while the US has been less enthusiastic.  Countries such as Japan, Australia, and Canada have been in the middle, depending on which party was in party at a particular time.

After the 2007 Australian election, one of the first international gestures of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's new government was to sign on to the Kyoto Protocol at the COP-13 meeting in Bali, helping to pave the way for the <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_13/items/4049.php">Bali Road Map</a>.

Could something similar happen with the new Japanese government of Yukio Hatoyama?  The <a href="http://www.dpj.or.jp/news/?num=14834">DPJ campaigned on a climate platform</a> that calls for a 25% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels, placing them squarely in line with European targets.

Although in the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSSP438075">past, the DPJ had called for instituting a carbon tax</a>, during this election they dropped the demand and said that they would "consider" the idea.

It will be interesting to see how Hatoyama acts in the next few weeks on the climate issue.  He will be attending a UN summit on climate change in New York sponsored by Ban Ki Moon next month which will be his first appearance on the major global stage.   Many will expect him to be bold--particularly on emissions targets--since <a href="http://www.dpj.or.jp/news/?num=16473">last month he met</a> with Ban Ki Moon and unequivocally endorsed the 25% reduction.

On the other hand, the DJP election was less of an endorsement of the party's policies as much as it was a rejection of the Liberal Party and their perceived mishandling of the economy.  Because of this, it is probably not realistic to expect radical domestic policy shifts on climate.  The DJP coalition has a variety of viewpoints and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=aqUTcGXMMB6A">Japanese industry is already expressing concern</a> about the 25% target.

Nevertheless, having Japan step away from the US position on climate is more promising for a Copenhagen agreement than would have otherwise been the case.

		<title>India Projects Low Per-Capita Emissions Growth</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=376</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh released a <a href="http://www.envfor.nic.in/mef/GHG_report.pdf">report [.pdf]</a> today that looks at five different projections for greenhouse gas emission growth in the country over the course of the next 23 years.  <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9a279d6e-97b0-11de-a927-00144feabdc0.html?nclick_check=1">The report contends</a> that India's emissions are set to rise, but they will remain lower than the global per-capita emissions level.

The average from the five studies estimates that per-capita emissions in India will grow to 2.1 tons of CO2e by 2020 and 3.5 tons of CO2e by 2030.  This would put them well under the current global average of about 8 tons per-capita, but above the 2 ton number that economists such as Nicholas Stern have argued are necessary to ward off extensive climate damage.

The release of the report seems intended to fortify India's position that it should not have to abide by binding emissions reduction targets in any global deal.   Its release came on the day that UK climate minister, Ed Miliband, was in India.  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/02/india-copenhagen-ed-miliband">In an interview with the Guardian</a>, Miliband embraced the idea that India should not be required to reduce emissions by 2020, although he apparently was less certain about longer term restrictions.

The specifics on timetables and binding reductions seem to be getting more difficult as the clock ticks down to the December negotiations in Copenhagen.

		<title>Pro Squash in Chicago</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Chicago is lucky enough this year to be the host of the <a href="http://www.usopen-squash.com/">US Open Squash Championship</a>. It is one of the top pro tournaments in the country and is being held in a dramatic setting:  a glass court temporarily erected at Michigan Avenue and the Chicago River.

The US Squash Federation was probably hoping that having Chicago host this year's tournament would both help squash get selected for the 2016 Olympics as well as provide evidence of the city's ability to host top international sporting events in advance of its bid to host the 2016 games.

Unfortunately, the IOC decided not to include squash for 2016.  The decision on the host city will be made next month.

I'll be attending the matches this weekend and will provide some posts on the matches.

Yesterday's first round didn't have any surprises.  Number two seed Amr Shabana handily defeated Canadian #1, Shahier Razik, while fifth seed, Englishman Adrian Grant, swept Saurav Ghosal in 3 games.  In the other bracket, last year's Windy City Squash champion, Peter Barker, held off a spirited Gilly Lane.  In the most contentious match of the evening, British phenom James Willstrop gave up one game in his ultimate victory over Julian Illingsworth.

Today's quarterfinals start at 5pm and include the following matchups:

Ramy Ashour (Egypt) vs Wael El Hindi (Egypt)
David Palmer (Aus) vs  Olli Tuominen (Finland)
Peter Barker (Eng) vs  James Willstrop (UK)
Amr Shabana (Egypt) vs Adrian Grant (UK)]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US Squash Open Final Tonight in Downtown Chicago</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The US Squash Open in Chicago is taking place tonight at 7pm in Chicago in the picturesque setting on North Michigan Avenue.

The final features the number one seed Ramy Ashour vs. number two seed Amr Shabana.  Both of the Egyptians had little problem advancing through the semifinals.

Shabana dispatched the Englishman James Willstrop with relative ease as he came out strong in the first game soring six points in a row.  Willstrop made a game of it, scoring 8 points but he was unable to solve Shabana's power and stamina.  The previous night, Willstrop beat Peter Barker in an 81-minute marathon and his fatigue showed as Shabana dominated him in three straight games to win the match.

Ashour faced the Australian David Palmer.  The 33 year-old Palmer played Ashour tight, focusing on a battle of endurance with the Egyptian Ashour, ten years his junior.

Palmer kept it close, but the savvy Ashour wasn't put off by the hard-hitting Palmer.  Ashour covered the court and deployed his devastating drop shot at key moments to exhaust Palmer.

Tonight's match should be a good one.  Ashour hasn't lost a game the entire tournament, while Shabana lost one game to Adrian Martin in the quarterfinals.  It is hard to bet against Ashour--his confidence and youth have been unstoppable.  He has also beat Shabana in recent head-to-head match-ups.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US Climate Envoy Briefs Congress</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=393</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2009 15:51:44 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday Todd Stern, the US State Department's Special Envoy on Climate Change <a href="http://globalwarming.house.gov/pubs?id=0009#main_content">addressed the House select committee</a> on climate change.  I didn't get a chance to watch the hearing, but a couple of interesting things came out according to media reports.

First, he reiterated the importance of having Congress pass a climate bill by the time that the UN convenes climate negotiations in December, saying that having a climate law immanent would give the US <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h5iS14YOIUrpdmPuNylwKcVpSnmAD9AKK15O0">"credibility and leverage"</a> in negotiations.

Of course, he was speaking to the wrong audience.  The House passed its version of a climate and energy bill in June and is now waiting on the Senate.  The Senate has delayed consideration of climate legislation with the battle over health care reform taking center stage in Congressional deliberations.  This has make <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE5883HD20090909">Senators from a wide variety of backgrounds</a> less than optimistic about passage of legislation.  Some key Senators--<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2009/09/09/09climatewire-senate-dems-send-small-signs-of-progress-on-10605.html">namely Kerry and Boxer</a>--are not giving up the fight and expect initial legislation to be introduced this month.

Stern also made mention of the difficulties ahead of Copenhagen with regard to aid to developing countries to shift to low carbon economic growth.  This is a major issue in negotiations with large emitters like China insistent that significaant financial flows from North to South be included in any agreement.  For countries poorer than China, guaranteed aid to deal with adaptation as well as mitigation is essential.

Before Stern's remarks the <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/0911/1224254277240.html">European Commission released a plan</a> that assumed developing countries would need $145 billion annually  by 2020 in climate-related aid.  Stern made no definitive response to the European proposal and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2009/09/11/11climatewire-still-no-money-for-developing-nations-new-g-20933.html">a document released today</a> by the US Treasury Department in advance of a meeting of G-20 finance ministers calls for increased money but doesn't provide specific committments.

The European proposal has been seen as a way to jump-start negotiations, but the US silence suggests the move may not have been entirely successful.

<a href="http://theenergycollective.com/TheEnergyCollective/47713">Obama is scheduled to give a major speech</a> on climate at the UN meeting in New York later this month.  Perhaps at that juncture he will be  bit more forthcoming with the US position.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Clean Water Act Ignored by Feds, States, and Polluters</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=397</link>
		<pubDate>Sun, 13 Sep 2009 16:51:26 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://is.gd/3e40r">New York Times published a devastating article today</a> on the erosion of enforcement of the Clean Water Act over the past few years.  The article discusses how pollution of water sources nationwide has increased while the federal EPA and many state agencies have done nothing to penalize violators.

Much of this has to do with the hostility to regulation that marked the Bush Administration's ideology and the fact that state and federal administrators do not have the budgets needed to adequately insure compliance with water safety legislation.

The phenomena is prevalent throughout the country, but the article discusses an interesting example in West Virginia where coal mining operations essentially pump sludge and other byproducts of mining into aquifers, thus polluting the groundwater.

Another problematic source for polluting stems from pesticide and fertilizer runoff in the big agricultural states of the Midwest.

Problems with water safety are scandalously under-reported, so it is good to see the Times spending resources to compile information (they have also compiled a database of violations available on <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/toxic-waters/polluters">their website</a>).

It also helps to show the integrated nature of environmental problems which needs to inform policy debates.  Coal not only is problematic from the standpoint of greenhouse gas emissions, but also can literally kill people through pollution of groundwater.   Assuming you can sequester CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants, the public health issues related to its mining still persist.   Furthermore, the fact that poor water quality stemming from industry's indiscretions hurt people's health should also be brought into current debates pertaining to health care and health insurance.  If water sources polluted by industry in particular locales results in higher negative health outcomes, don't the polluters bear some responsibility for bearing the costs of health care for its victims?

Similarly, the article discusses agriculture as a problematic source of water pollution.  This stems from monoculture production of commodity crops such as corn, soybeans, etc...These crops need toxic enhancements to grow which, in turn, contaminate groundwater.

The irony here is that polluting monocrop agriculture is highly subsidized.  The products--such as corn--are converted into such products as animal feed or high fructose corn syrup which contribute to the high carbon footprint of agriculture and health problems such as obesity.

Thus, the system that produces dirty water also produces dirty air and bad public health in a myriad of ways.

It is good to see the current EPA administrator express concern about the current situation.  Remedying these systemic problems will likely take a lot of time and resources.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>World Leaders to Copenhagen?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the first meeting of global heads of state to discuss climate change being convened this week at the United Nations headquarters in New York, it is becoming imperative that aggressive high level leadership will be needed to get a global deal negotiated by the end of the year.

One way of moving forward in this regard is for world leaders to get personally involved in the negotiating process instead of deferring the job to underlings.  Thus, it is promising to note that <a href="http://www.edspledge.com/gordon-brown-copenhagen">British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has announced</a> that he will personally attend the UN Climate Change negotiations in Copenhagen.

It was also <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2009/09/obama_may_dash_over_to_copenha.html">reported today that US President Barack Obama</a> may go to Copenhagen as well.  His potential visit, however, will be in October to meet with the International Olympic Committee to support Chicago's Olympic bid.

If Obama is more willing to engage personally for a sporting event instead of one of the most important global policy discussions of the twentieth century, itis not likely to be perceived as a positive step by climate delegates in Copenhagen.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Brief Rundown of UN Secretary General&#039;s Climate Summit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is climate week in New York!  Before tomorrow's opening of the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Secretary General Ban Ki Moon <a href="http://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/climatechange/lang/en/pages/2009summit">held a summit</a> on climate change.

Given the slow progress thus far to meet the December deadline of putting together a global climate deal,  it was hoped that today's meeting of leaders might breathe some life into the negotiations.

The entire proceedings are available via webcast from the UN.  I haven't had a chance to watch them, but I did skim the <a href="http://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/climatechange/pages/2009summit/programme">prepared remarks</a> from some of the global leaders.

For a nice pithy assessment of what is at stake, the head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,  Rajendra Pachauri's remarks are useful.  He reminded leaders that the science tells us that doing nothing will result in a planetary temperature increase of somewhere between 1.1 &amp; 6 degrees C, with a likely range between 1.8 &amp; 4.   The G8 leaders agreed that warming should be limited to 2° C.  Because of the lagging nature of warming and emissions, this would require a peak level of emissions by 2015.

After Pachauri's comments, various leaders took the podium, beginning with US President Barack Obama.  His speech was vague and not revelatory in terms of stating what sort of action the US was going to take to limit greenhouse gas emissions and how (and how much) rich countries will finance adaptation aid to poor countries bearing the brunt of the climate crisis.  It was pretty disappointing.  Being the largest per-capita emitter, the US needs to show some leadership in agreeing to binding emissions cuts and in financing its fair share of any adaptation fund.  Obama danced around the issues, offering no specifics about reductions targets.

Maldivian President Mohammed Nasheed followed and didn't mince his words.  He called for developed countries to reduce their emissions enough to quell warming at 1.5°C by accepting legally binding targets.  He also said that if developed countries accepted these ambitious targets, then developing countries would also be prepared to accept their own more modest targets if rich countries helped out with the financing.

Nasheed's deal is sound--requiring appropriate binding emissions on the part of all countries.  Rich countries, however, have to show leadership and help poorer nations reach their own goals.

Rawandan President Paul Kagame had an interesting proposal: develop a global carbon emissions trading scheme based on per capita emissions.  Pick a safe cap--he suggested 2 metric tones of CO2E per year--and allow global trading.  Countries with low per-capita levels would receive flows of financing from high per capita countries that would allow the former to sustain forests and invest in renewable energy.  Kagame's plan also seems more equitable since it uses per-capita numbers to evaluate which countries should reduce their emissions.

The new Japanese Prime Minister, Yukio Hatoyama, reflected the seriousness with which his government is embarking on negotiations by getting precise about emissions targets--a reduction by 25% from 1990 levels.  Hatoyama also gave some detail on how he would like to see aid distributed--a major issue for developing countries skeptical of the demands of multilateral institutions.  He specifically called for financing to go through the "UN climate change regime"--as opposed to the World Bank, which may not have the same environmental goals.

Rounding out the session were speeches by Nicholas Sarkozy, Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, and Hu Jintao of China.

In sum, it is not clear how this event will impact the negotiations.  There obviously will be back-door maneuvering this week in New York which may move things along.

Obama's speech was a bit of a disappointment given the expectations that the US would change radically under the new administration.   Although these expectations have always been a bit overblown, it is surprising that US has maintained such a noncommittal position.  Obviously this may not bode well for real action in Copenhagen.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bangkok Climate Negotiation Sessions Begin</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On the heels of last week's G-20 meetings and UN Secretary Ban Ki Moon's climate change summit, negotiators working on the global climate agreement are meeting in Bangkok for a two week session. This is the first of two sessions prior to the big meeting in Copenhagen where a global deal is supposed to be developed.

Informal negotiations last month didn't produce much other than<a href="http://unfccc.int/documentation/documents/advanced_search/items/3594.php?rec=j&amp;priref=600005444#beg"> an effort to re-order</a> the draft negotiating text.  It was hoped at the time that the Secretary General's summit might breathe some life into the negotiations.  Although there were some good signs last week--<a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1926384,00.html?iid=tsmodule">in particular, China's pledge to decrease carbon intensity and the G20's agreement to stop fuel subsidies</a>--concrete signs were not evident on crucial issues of specific emissions reduction commitments for developed countries nor on financing levels to help developing countries adopt low-carbon technologies.

Thus, finding common ground doesn't seem to be any easier today than last month.  Nevertheless, speakers at <a href="http://unfccc2.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/090928_AWG_Bangkok/templ/live_page.php?id_kongresssession=1986&amp;player_mode=isdn_real">this morning's opening ceremony</a> in Bangkok tried to rally delegates  by imploring them to find common ground and--crucially--pare down the lengthy negotiating text.

With a text that's over 200 pages, this is going to be a monumental task to undertake in the next two weeks.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US Strikes Hopeful Tone at Bangkok Climate Talks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Head US climate negotiator Jonathan Pershing reiterated the US commitment to coming up with a global climate deal by the end of the year.  In a <a href="http://unfccc2.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/090928_AWG_Bangkok/templ/ply_page.php?id_kongresssession=1995&amp;player_mode=isdn_real">news conference</a> held during talks in Bangkok, he emphasized the need for delegates over the next two weeks to pare down the 200-page negotiating document into something more manageable.

His prepared comments seemed to point to a possible reconciliation with China on emissions reductions.  The US has generally been vague on what they  would like to see from China, India and other emergent industrial nations; however today Pershing explicitly indicated that the US wants to see a reduction from business-as-usual projections from these countries.

Of course, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/cif-green/2009/sep/22/china-climate-pledge-new-york">last week Chinese President Hu Jintao told </a>the UN that China would include a reduction in carbon intensity in their mid-term economic planning.  Stretching back to the Clinton Administration, opponents to US participation in global climate deals used China's growing emissions as an argument against developing domestic targets.   It is unreasonable to expect China to make an overall reduction in emissions given their low per-capita  emission levels, so some reduction from business-as-usual projections would be positive.

Pershing was less sanguine about a Copenhagen agreement which included specific emissions reductions numbers.  He seemed to predict a structured document whose numbers would be filled in over the first few months of 2010.  This suggests that the Administration is not expecting the Senate to pass a domestic emissions reductions bill by December, but nonetheless want to see some type of agreement emerge out of the Copenhagen meeting.

The problem with this approach is that it will be easy for global coordinated action to be delayed.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Obama Going to Copenhagen </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Barack-Obama-to-Travel-to-Copenhagen/">White House just announced</a> that US President Barack Obama will be going to Copenhagen...to support Chicago's Olympic bid.

If the President is willing to travel across the world to try and lobby the International Olympic Committee to award the games to Chicago, there should be no excuse for him to travel back to Copenhagen in December to help hash out a climate deal.

Many heads of government have announced their intention to attend the COP15 talks--including <a href="http://en.cop15.dk/news/view+news?newsid=2148">British Prime Minister Gordon Brown</a>.  In Brown's estimation, having the highest level of representation in Copenhagen shows the urgency needed to hash out a global deal.

If Obama goes to Copenhagen to support a two-week sporting event and fails to attend a historic meeting in the same city to transform the world's economy towards a low-carbon path, the symbolism will be noted by delegations from other countries.

It won't bode well for generating a global response for dealing with one of the most pressing issues of our time.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US Senate Climate Bill Released</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today Senators Boxer and Kerry are officially releasing the draft text of the Senate climate and energy bill.  Among the highlights of the <a href="http://www.eenews.net/public/25/12579/features/documents/2009/09/29/document_pm_03.pdf">text that was leaked yesterday [.pdf]</a>:
<ul>
	<li>A reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to 20% of 2005 levels by 2020.  This would essentially meet US reduction obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.  Of course the US wouldn't meet the 2012 time line, but this is a relatively strong target.  The House version of the bill calls for only a 17% reduction from 2005.</li>
	<li>It also appears that the Senate version will give the Environmental Protection Agency more latitude to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.  The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/09/15/15greenwire-white-house-rolls-out-details-of-auto-fuel-eco-13342.html">EPA is already starting to take an aggressive stance</a> on regulation.  The House bill, however, strips a significant amount of authority from the EPA for instituting greenhouse gas regulation.</li>
	<li>On the issue of dealing with emissions from transportation, the Senate bill offers grants for transit-oriented development, but according to Streetsblog, <a href="http://dc.streetsblog.org/2009/09/29/senate-climate-bill-leaks-the-good-news-and-bad-news-for-transport/">it is unclear what proportion of revenue</a> generated from the sale of emissions permits would go to low-carbon transportation (e.g. mass transit, cycling, bus).   The House version advocates around 1%, while many environmentalists argue that a 10% investment would be more sufficient.</li>
</ul>
On the whole, reports about the Senate bill suggest that it is quite strong.  Obviously the details will change as Senate committees hold hearings later this month.  But if it looks like something close to the draft is passed, it will give the Obama Administration quite a bit of leverage going into international negotiations in Copenhagen later this year.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bangkok Climate Talks Enter Second Week</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[UN negotiators in Bangkok entered their second week of negotiations yesterday in the effort to develop a workable draft document for December's summit in Copenhagen.

It is a bit unclear exactly what progress has been made.  One standoff is brewing abut how to reconcile the two parallel negotiating streams that were agreed to two years ago in Bali. Essentially, one stream is discussing modifications to the Kyoto Protocol while another is looking to the possibility of a new agreement.

This was set up this way to gloss over conflict between the US--which is not a party to the Kyoto Protocol--and the developing world--who want to maintain Kyoto's distinction between industrialized and developing countries.

The US rejected Kyoto more than a decade ago because it felt that emerging economies like China and India should be required to meet binding emissions targets.  With many developing countries (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSSP495601">such as Indonesia</a>) now agreeing to or implementing emissions reductions policies, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2009/oct/05/secrecy-bangkok-climate-talks">observers in Bangkok</a> are now calling on the US to get more specific with its commitments.

Although there is still deadlock on the big issues, there has been some modification of the negotiating documents.  Angela Anderson of the US Climate Action Network <a href="http://unfccc2.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/090928_AWG_Bangkok/templ/ply_page.php?id_kongresssession=2009&amp;player_mode=isdn_real">observed</a> that the US is pushing for adaptation financing for developed countries to be coordinated by the UN climate change secretariat.  This is significant since it would better insure that adaptation funds are used for their expressed purpose rather than be put into general projects that might be incidental to climate-related problems.

(Just after I wrote the above paragraph, however, the Climate Action Network is now holding a press conference that questions their earlier assessment--things move fast during negotiations)

Also, the Rainforest Action Network <a href="http://unfccc2.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/090928_AWG_Bangkok/templ/ply_page.php?id_kongresssession=2025&amp;player_mode=isdn_real">discussed</a> problems with the wording of the negotiating text on forest protection.  At issue is the document's endorsement of "sustainable forest management," which RAN argues will give logging companies the ability to actually destroy forests rather than protect them.  Because what constitutes "sustainable" forestry is ill-defined, <a href="http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=219141&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC">these activists argue</a> that logging companies will be able to get subsidies for projects that are ostensibly save more trees then they might "normally" have cut down.

The forest element--or REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation)--is an essential part of a post-Kyoto agreement.  Deforestation is a large contributor to global warming and is largely a developing world phenomenon.  Thus, financing mechanisms (possibly through offset trading on a carbon market) aretrying to be worked out which will "incentivize" forest protection.   The real threat could be that these cash flows are not going to actual protection and turn into a windfall for resource industries.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>EPA to Study Atrazine Regulations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/business/energy-environment/07water.html?hp">New York Times is reporting</a> that the EPA is going to investigate the health risks associated with the herbicide atrazine.  Atrazine is used in agriculture, landscaping, and golf courses to control weeds and has been shown to contaminate groundwater.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/us/23water.html?_r=1">Excessive exposure to the chemical has been linked</a> to elevated risks for cancer and birth defects.

This is long overdue.  <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/health/pesticides/natrazine.asp">The Natural Resources Defense Council sued the EPA </a>during the Bush years to force a reconsideration of the current regulations on atrazine, but was met with resistance.

Today's move shows that the EPA under Lisa Jackson is assuming a more aggressive stance towards protecting human health.

Since <a href="http://www.sfchron.com/cgi-bin/blogs/green/detail?blogid=49&amp;entry_id=46358">atrazine is primarily used in heavily-subsidized corn production</a>, it would also be helpful for federal officials concerned with agriculture to investigate ways to reduce its use.  Taking the radical step of subsidizing less environmentally problematic production methods might be a start.

In the European Union, <a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/foodsafety/atrazine102703.cfm">atrazine has been banned for years</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Future of Kyoto Protocol Sticking Point at Bangkok Talks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the penultimate pre-Copenhagen climate negotiations wind down this week in Bangkok, it appears that long-standing tensions between the United States and developing countries are reaching the boiling point.

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="240" caption="Photo: Adopt a Negotiator"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adoptanegotiator/"><img title="Bangkok Climate Talks" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2528/3961317295_8f5e28df92_m.jpg" alt="Photo: Adopt a Negotiator" width="240" height="160" /></a>[/caption]

At issue is the future of the Kyoto protocol which the US has not ratified, but which developing countries want to extend after its first commitment period ends in 2012.  <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/asiaCrisis/idUSSP379681">Reuters is reporting</a> that the G77 negotiators, representing developing countries, walked out of an informal meeting on Wednesday after the US insisted on shelving Kyoto for an entirely new agreement.

The US, of course, is not a party to Kyoto and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/oct/07/kyoto-copenhagen-un-climate-change">according to head negotiator</a> Jonathan Pershing "we are not going to be in the Kyoto protocol."  Developing countries, however, see the rejection of Kyoto as a rejection of the principle that developed countries should bear the bulk of the responsibility for emissions reductions since they have historically been the largest contributors.

It is a bit disconcerting that this dispute is only now stalling negotiations since the basic point of contention has been apparent for years.   Back in 2007 parties to the UN climate change convention established a parallel negotiating structure with Kyoto parties discussing the post-2012 environment on the one hand and an <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/items/4381.php">"Ad Hoc Working Group on Long Term Cooperative Action"</a> on the other.

At the time it may have made sense since the Bush administration was decidedly antagonistic to the whole idea that climate change was a problem.  However, the result seems to have been to sweep real differences under the rug only to surface at the 11th hour of negotiations.

That said, <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/india/Murder-of-Kyoto-Protocol-will-end-chances-of-climate-deal-G77/articleshow/5094792.cms">there is still a perception</a> amongst delegates that despite the change in administration, the US is still dragging its feet at the negotiating table.  Although Obama has made statements that he thinks of the US as a "leader" in negotiations, the fact that the US delegation can't come to the table with an explicit set of binding reduction targets is not likely to be helpful.

This is particularly problematic since the US and other G8 countries pledged to limit global warming to 2 degrees in line with the scientific assessments.  At this stage in the game, the emissions pledges on the table <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/emissions-pledges-not-up-to-the-mark-report-20091007-gn96.html">won't be enough to meet that goal</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Obama&#039;s Nobel Prize--Implications for Climate Talks?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[US President Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize today.   The award comes just several short months into his Presidency, making him quite a surprise pick.  Normally the committee makes these awards after significant breakthroughs in international peace or long careers in diplomacy or development.

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="240" caption="Photo: White House"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/"><img title="Obama and Sarkozy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2658/3993804035_7844e03083_m.jpg" alt="Photo: White House" width="240" height="160" /></a>[/caption]

<a href="http://climateprogress.org/2009/10/09/president-obama-wins-nobel-peace-prize-climate-change-copenhagen/">Climate Progress </a>has an interesting angle on the implications of the award on the international climate change talks underway.   They point out that in the <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2009/press.html">announcement</a> of the prize, the Nobel committee mentions that "thanks to Obama's initiative, the USA is now playing a more constructive role in meeting the great climatic challenges the world is confronting."

Close observers of the US stance in the climate talks will acknowledge a change in the US attitude at the talks since Obama took office.  But there has been much less movement of the actual US position on key issues such as mitigation.  In fact, the meetings this past week in Bangkok nearly ground to a halt as developing countries accused the US of being a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSSP337818">"stumbling block"</a> in efforts to advance the negotiations.   They have essentially moved from being obstructionist under President Bush to being non-committal.

Climate Progress suggests, however, that the Nobel could be the shot-in-the-arm needed to breathe energy into the talks.  Obama mentioned the challenge of climate change in his <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/10/obama-i-will-accept-this-award-as-a-call-to-action.php?ref=fpban">address</a> this morning where he said he looked upon the award as a "call to action."

It has been reported that <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/10/09/nobel-peace-prize-obama.html?ref=rss">he will attend</a> the award ceremony in Oslo on December 10.   This falls late in the first week of the big climate talks in Copenhagen--a mere hour flight away.

The timing isn't perfect.  As <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/environment/2009/10/09/will-nobel-prize-also-take-obama-to-copenhagen-climate-talks/">Reuters points out</a>, the high level ministerial sessions begin six days later on the 16th.  There is a movement from civil society groups to push heads of government to attend the sessions in order to highlight the urgent need for a global deal.

Regardless of whether Obama attends the meeting in Copenhagen or not, his presence in the region in the midst of the talks to accept an award for his global leadership will certainly influence the proceedings.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jake Schmidt of the National Resources Defense Council has <a href="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jschmidt/india_dealmaker_copenhagen.html">an interesting post</a> discussing a speech given yesterday by India's Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh.

I've reported on <a href="http://cop15.us/?p=108">statements made by Ramesh</a> in the past few months that have been perceived as being relatively provocative.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="240" caption="Photo of Jairam Ramesh: Matthew McDermott"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/matmcdermott/"><img title="Jairam Ramesh " src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2542/3945921526_84c5e8181f_m.jpg" alt="photo of Jairam Ramesh: Matthew McDermott" width="240" height="160" /></a>[/caption]

Schmidt's post, however, suggests that Ramesh is shifting tone. Yesterday he apparently highlighted the vulnerabilities faced by the country from climate change and highlighted the numerous domestic policies being undertaken to mitigate emissions, particularly with regard to regulations requiring efficiency in transport &amp; building, expansion of renewable energy production, and deforestation.

With this approach it seems like India is following China's strategy of highlighting domestic action to claim the moral high ground while the United States continues to stay quiet on the key issue of mitigation targets.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Financing For Developing Countries Major Sticking Point for Climate Talks</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=437</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/15/science/earth/15climate.html?em">New York Times has a nice article</a> explaining the persistent tension between the G-77 (and China) and the industrialized countries.  It basically comes down to money.

In UN parlance, this is concern over <a href="http://unfccc.int/ttclear/jsp/index.jsp"><em>technology transfer</em></a> and <a href="http://unfccc.int/adaptation/items/4159.php"><em>adaptation</em></a>.  The highest rates of growth for carbon usage are in developing countries; but these countries see this growth as essential to developing vibrant economies.  They are willing to use low carbon alternatives, but argue that the West should pay for it since the West had the luxury of deploying decades of high carbon growth.

"Adaptation" refers to the urgent money needed to help the most vulnerable countries adapt to the immediate challenges of a hotter planet.  Part of what makes these countries (like small island developing states) so vulnerable is rapid change and inadequate resources.  Given that these countries didn't contribute to the climate problem, any global deal will need to have significant financing.

The current Kyoto structure for financing is woefully inadequate.  There is a small tax placed on carbon credits, but it hasn't raised nearly enough money.  The article places the figure at $18 million.  Nicholas Stern says that there should be about $85 billion per year going to adaptation.

The rich countries have not agreed on a financing framework. The EU is proposing somewhere between $33-$74 billion per year.  Even if that figure was agreed to in theory, the mechanisms by which financing would be insured are uncertain.  The West generally likes to push market and private sector solutions; but the the G-77 prefers direct transfer from governments, arguing that market mechanisms can be too unpredictable.

With all of the talk in the US about emissions reductions, it is important to recognize that the North-South financing issue may be an even bigger obstacle in the journey to secure a global deal.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Movement on Senate Climate Bill Expected</title>

After being introduced in draft form two weeks ago, there seems to be a push to at least get hearings underway this month and--perhaps--a vote by the time negotiators meet in Copenhagen for the UN climate change conference.

There are several committees that have jurisdiction on the energy and climate bill, but the chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Barbara Boxer, has tentatively scheduled hearings to begin on October 27 followed by a markup of the bill.  The Senate takes a couple of weeks off in November for Thanksgiving and Veterans Day, but it is conceivable that a bill could come to the floor early in December.

Even if the Senate hasn't voted on the full legislation by Copenhagen, positive action by key committees will help the US negotiators in Copenhagen support their position that the US is being proactive on mitigation.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>More Evidence Linking Urban Design With Health Outcomes </title>

As the evidence piles up linking sprawling, automobile-centric, urban design with poor health outcomes,  you wonder when policymakers are going to start linking public health concerns with efforts underway to reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality.  All of these environmental factors result in negative outcomes in numerous policy areas.  Sensible land use reform and smart planning could possibly be a crucial step in solving a host of social problems with a single policy intervention.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Madison, Wisconsin Engaged in Zoning Reform</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't know the details about what is going on in Madison, but this <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt_and_politics/article_95cc612c-b903-11de-9398-001cc4c03286.html">article in the State-Journal</a> caught my eye.

Apparently the city is engaged in a re-working of its zoning code with an emphasis on "environmental sustainability."  Among the changes <a href="http://www.cityofmadison.com/neighborhoods/zoningRewrite/">being discussed in the latest draft</a>:
<ul>
	<li>Reducing the minimum parking requirements for commercial buildings.  One of the reasons you see a sea of asphalt surrounding your local Big Box retailer is because traditional zoning codes often require that a minimum proportion of the lot be dedicated to parking.  New Urbanists have been <a href="http://www.urbanreviewstl.com/?p=4820">arguing for years</a> that zoning codes should include maximums, rather than minimums.  Too much parking results in a degraded environment and an expectation that automobiles should be the primary mode of transport.

	<li>Allowing for urban agriculture and gardening.  According to the article, there will be no prohibition on the siting of community gardens and special permission could be granted for small scale agricultural projects.  This is a nice effort to promote local sustainability and food security.</li>
	<li>Allows for "granny flats" to be built over garages.  This is another New Urbanist staple.  It diversifies the housing stock in neighborhoods, offers a bit of income to home owners, and can enhance affordability</li>
</ul>
The process of reform is ongoing, but if this article is any indication Madison appears to be on a positive track.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This example comes from the <a href="http://djcoregon.com/news/2009/10/12/can-street-layouts-affect-residents%E2%80%99-health/">Daily Journal of Commerce</a> in Portland, Oregon.  The article, headlined "Can Street Layout Affect Residents' Health," talks specifically about the problem posed by emergency vehicles getting to residential destinations in the Powellhurst-Gilbert neighborhood.

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="342" caption="Photo: Portland Ground, Pictures of Portland Oregon"]<a href="http://www.portlandground.com/archives/2006/01/pallas_club_on_2.php"><img title="Powellhurst Gilbert" src="http://www.portlandground.com/powelhurstgilbert/2005-11-26portland137thPowe.jpg" alt="Photo: Portland Ground, Pictures of Portland Oregon" width="342" height="226" /></a>[/caption]

I haven't been to the neighborhood, but the article describes it as having typical post-war design--a street system lacking connectivity with plenty of cul-de-sacs and dead ends.  This caused a problem recently when emergency vehicles couldn't reach the scene of a shooting resulting in the death of a high school student.

<a href="http://www.cnu.org/node/2038">New Urbanists and public safety departments have been at odds for years,</a> with the latter insisting on wide residential roads and generous, rounded corners to accommodate large fire trucks.   Planners aren't excited about the ramifications this has for street life and the pedestrian experience.  Streets become too wide, automobile traffic goes too fast, and sidewalks are sacrificed by developers to meet the zoning and infrastructure requirements for emergency vehicles.

The incident in Powellhurst-Gilbert suggests that old-style suburbia also has some problems.

In keeping with the study I referenced earlier, Powellhurst-Gilbert also was found to have issues relating to obesity that have been linked to the neighborhood's urban design.  What is hopeful from the article is that city officials are looking at ways to change policy and seem to have the support of neighbors--something that is often lacking in other urban and suburban contexts.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Paris Bike Sharing Scheme Challenged by Vandals</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=448</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/31/world/europe/31bikes.html?_r=1&amp;hpw">New York Times</a> has a front page story on the Paris bike sharing scheme, <a href="http://www.velib.paris.fr/"><em>Vélib</em></a>'. According to the article 80% of the system's 20,600 bicycles are either stolen or broken.  The article suggests that the vandalism stems from class-based resentment--suburban youth view the system, which is popular with Paris' cosmopolitan young professionals and tourists, as a frivolous investment that does little to  help mobility for underprivileged communities in the region.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="240" caption="Photo by Gamebouille"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gameboy974/"><img title="Vleib bikes" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2038/2520301962_e48a673964_m.jpg" alt="Photo by Gamebouille" width="240" height="180" /></a>[/caption]

There may be something to that explanation; however, the Times article brings to mind an almost-identical<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7881079.stm"> story done by the BBC in February</a>.   After that article appeared, <a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2009/02/12/reports-of-velibs-demise-greatly-exaggerated/">bike sharing advocates suggested</a> that the notion of a failed and dysfunctional Velib system is highly exaggerated and had more to do, perhaps, with the operator's desire to negotiate a better deal with the municipal government.

As similar systems come online and evolve in Montreal, Minneapolis, Boston, and the District of Columbia, it will be interesting to see if/how vandalism emerges in these other contexts.  The <a href="http://bike-sharing.blogspot.com/">Bike Sharing Blog</a>, out of Washington is a good place to follow all the happenings in this growing transport sector.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Republicans Seek to Stall Senate Climate Bill</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After a week of hearings convened by the Environment and Public Works committee chair, Senator Barbara Boxer, it appears that the Boxer-Kerry bill is facing some obstacles.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="275" caption="Republican Climate Change Skeptic, Senator James Inhofe"]<img title="Inhofe" src="http://www.sfgate.com/blogs/images/sfgate/green/2008/12/10/inhofe.jpg" alt="Republican Climate Change Skeptic, Senator James Inhofe" width="275" height="258" />[/caption]

Yesterday <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/31/AR2009103101048.html">it was reported by Reuters</a> that all of the Republicans on the committee will boycott Tuesday's scheduled meeting to mark up the bill in anticipation for a full committee vote.  This effectively stalls committee work since at least two of the committee's seven Republicans have to show up for a mark up to commence. Boxer could<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2009/10/30/30climatewire-senate-climate-markup-set-for-tuesday-but-wi-24178.html"> pursue other avenues</a> to bring the bill to the floor.

Republicans are demanding that the EPA conduct a full cost analysis of the bill before moving forward in spite of EPA Lisa Jackson's release of a <a href="http://www.eenews.net/public/25/13011/features/documents/2009/10/24/document_daily_01.pdf">preliminary analysis [.pdf]</a> last week that contends the economic impact of the bill will be negligible.

Republican obstructionism is compounded with <a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct2=us%2F0_0_s_0_0_t&amp;usg=AFQjCNGoiNIQPQk9rdBKgqPxsPbLnAwk8g&amp;cid=1461751215&amp;ei=SmzuStGUKKG-NZu4hc8C&amp;rt=MORE_COVERAGE&amp;vm=STANDARD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-dyn%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2F2009%2F11%2F01%2FAR2009110102593.html">lack of Democratic unity</a> on the bill as it stands now, making the promise of swift passage of Congressional climate legislation slim.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>&quot;Mission Impossible&quot; Begins in Barcelona</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today climate negotiators will meet in Barcelona to work through a series of <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/ad_hoc_working_groups/lca/items/5012.php">"non papers"</a> in the effort to make headway in advance of next month's UN climate talks in Copenhagen.

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="240" caption="Fira Barcelona, site of this week&#39;s negotiations Photo: UNFCCC"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/unfccc/"><img title="Fira Barcelona" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2682/4064160744_3c28a997a3_m.jpg" alt="Fira Barcelona, site of this weeks negotiations [Photo: UNFCCC]" width="240" height="74" /></a>[/caption]During the summer, the UN chief in charge of the negotiations, Yvo de Boer, had expressed confidence that a draft, 200 page, negotiating text hashed out during meetings in June could be pared down and made more simple in time for the December meeting.  Unfortunately, if you try looking at the non-papers, you will quickly see that there is little agreement on emissions mitigation targets, which countries should be responsible for reducing emissions, how developing countries should be compensated for adaptation and low-carbon growth, and a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8334985.stm">host of other roadblocks</a>.

Furthermore, stagnation in the US Senate could handcuff the United States, while key European countries (i.e. UK) are <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/nov/01/climate-change-world-leaders-accused">pushing for a "politically binding agreement" </a>that could be a precursor to a larger treaty.

This is perhaps why the top international climate scientist, Rajendra Pachauri, is saying that "political myopia" is trumping scientific sensibilities and unnamed diplomats are calling this week's meetings, <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-11/02/content_12370857.htm">"mission impossible."</a>

Still, there are interesting press reports from around the world expressing anticipation about the meetings:
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/India-may-come-under-pressure-at-Barcelona/articleshow/5187517.cms">Economic Times of India feels</a> that India may be asked for concessions in the form of agreeing to reduction of emissions growth, but points out that issues of finance and technology transfer have been ignored by the developing world.</li>
	<li>The host of the Copenhagen talks, <a href="http://www.eleconomista.es/telecomunicaciones-tecnologia/noticias/1660735/10/09/Delaying-UN-climate-deal-makes-no-sense-Denmark.html">Danish Environment Minister Connie Hedegaard is rejecting</a> the idea that a binding agreement can't be hatched in next month, saying it makes no sense to delay a treaty.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/11/02/doubts-remain-copenhagen-deal.html">Jakarta Post casts a pessimistic tone</a> on Barcelona, although points out that Indonesian Prime Minister Yudhoyono has agreed to reduce his country's emissions by 26% by 2020 and could reduce up to 41% with international financing.  The Post suggests that this move by Yudhoyono could be the basis for bridging some of the divide that separates the developed and developing countries.</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.watoday.com.au/environment/australias-getout-clause-on-bushfire-slammed-20091101-hrn5.html">Australia is under pressure for wanting to expand</a> the credit developed countries can get for carbon sinks in their countries.  The threat is that Australia could technically meet its emissions obligations without actually reducing carbon fuel consumption.</li>
	<li>Finally, the less-than-enthusiastic <a href="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/business/Pressure+president+climate+talks+Canada+says/2170136/story.html">Canadian government of Stephen Harper, is thankful</a> that the US position at the negotiations is being complicated by Congress since it allows Harper and his Environment Minister Jim Prentice to sit back and do little negotiating themselves.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the main issues facing international climate negotiators is how to deal with the Kyoto Protocol.   Two years ago in Bali, negotiators established two negotiating tracks--one that looks at what a second "commitment period" of the Kyoto Protocol would look like and another track that looks at "long-term cooperative action."

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="221" caption="Photo of Danish PM Lars Lokke Rasmussen"]<img title="Lars Lokke Rasmussen" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Lars_L%C3%B8kke_Rasmussen_foran_Amalienborg_7_april_2009.JPG" alt="Photo of Danish PM Lars Lokke Rasmussen" width="221" height="233" />[/caption]

The main reason for establishing the two tracks was to bring opponents of Kyoto (namely, the United States) into a constructive discussion without requiring them to commit to Kyoto's legally-binding emissions reduction elements.  Kyoto's first commitment period ends in 2012 and in 2007, when this negotiating strategy was developed, it was thought that there would be enough time to provide more clarity by the 2009 deadline.

Well, here we are in 2009 and there is no clarity.  Now with quite a bit at stake and a recognition that key bridging of differences has been proceeding at a snail's pace, many players are trying to salvage the process by predicting a "politically binding" commitment to be worked out in Copenhagen.

A politically binding commitment would differ from a legally binding commitment (such as the Kyoto Protocol) to the extent that there would be no force of law to insure that emissions reductions would be implemented.

Today, Tove Ryding of Greenpeace-Denmark <a href="http://unfccc2.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/091102_AWG_Barcelona/templ/ply_ondemand.php?id_kongresssession=2180&amp;player_mode=isdn_real">gave a strong rebuke</a> to her country's <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hlooRS0_O_i25l5aEztEUbIcBBSA">Prime Minister</a> for predicting a "politically binding" agreement.   Unfortunately, other political figures are using the term--including UN Secretary General <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/6494079/Tough-global-deal-on-climate-change-is-unlikely-this-year-says-Ban-Ki-Moon.html">Ban-Ki Moon</a>.

Developing countries, however, <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-11/03/content_12373967.htm">are insistent</a> that the legally binding force of the Kyoto Protocol be continued with China<a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-11/04/content_12381712.htm"> unequivocally endorsing</a> its continuation and a group of African countries actually shutting down the negotiations yesterday in frustration.

The problem with a politically binding commitment coming out of Copenhagen is that it won't be enforceable, likely be ineffective, and stall action on the issue.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Barcelona Climate Talks End, Outlook for Copenhagen Unclear</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The final talks before December's  Copenhagen climate summit ended Friday with very little to show.  There is no draft agreement.  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8347547.stm">According to the BBC</a>, the non-papers that formed the basis of discussions have not been elevated to a negotiating text.  And leaders are talking about a "political" statement coming out of next month's talks rather than a binding, legal agreement.

The<a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct2=us%2F0_0_s_0_2_aa&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFRn0Md2QIwXdytQ7xZmVbBSE9RA&amp;cid=1466551836&amp;ei=0mj3Soj_NpHoM6a9zT0&amp;rt=SEARCH&amp;vm=STANDARD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fenvironment%2Fclimate-change%2Fbureaucrats-clash-on-shape-of-climate-deal-1817259.html"> key sticking points remain</a>.  Developing countries want to maintain the legally binding Kyoto Protocol and have legally-binding mitigation commitments from the developed countries.  The US rejects Kyoto and won't commit to any mitigation numbers in the absence of Congressional action.  The <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1106/p06s02-woeu.html">EU has been basically treading water</a>.

Talks on REDD, the forest protection component of the climate talks, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-GreenBusiness/idUSTRE5A54V020091106">apparently resulted in a draft document</a> that excludes an enforcement mechanism.

Finally,<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-GreenBusiness/idUSTRE5A60QQ20091108?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=10522"> G-20 finance ministers failed</a> in their meeting in Scotland this weekend to agree on ways to finance low carbon development and adaptation for developing countries.  The <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/alistair-darling-there-are-substantial-barriers-to-a-climate-deal-1815731.html">UK estimates</a> that 100 billion Euros annually by 2020 is needed, but the US wouldn't step up to the table to commit to its share.

With that said, head UN climate official, <a href="http://www.ecoticias.com/co2/19444/UNFCCC-Executive-Secretary-Governments-Can-and-must-Deliver-Strong-Copenhagen-Deal-noticias-de-medio-medio-ambiente-medioambiente-medioambiental-co2-eficiencia-energetica-rsc-gases-de-efecto-invernadero-ahorro-energetico-renovables">Yvo de Boer, said</a> that Copenhagen can still produce a strong deal.]]></content:encoded>

In September, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/07/2736006.htm?section=justin">UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown implored</a> his fellow heads of state and government to make the trip to Copenhagen in order to emphasize the importance of the talks and to increase the pressure to come up with a strong deal.

<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/11/05/gore-to-obama-dont-skip-copenhagen/">Al Gore has said</a> he thinks President Obama will go, but the White House has been non-committal.

Yvo apparently didn't release a list, but said the Danish government had told him that 40 world leaders have already said they will be attending the talks.  So that begs the question?  Who are the Copenhagen 40?

We have 1) Brown, 2) <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2009/11/200911741650511736.html">Sarkozy</a>...Who else...?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>EPA Moving on Climate Without Congress</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=463</link>
		<pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2009 01:22:11 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While much of the current discussion surrounding climate policy in the United States tends to focus on Congress writing cap and trade legislation, it is important to note that Obama's EPA is steadfastly moving along the greenhouse gas regulatory process.

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="250" caption="EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson"]<img class=" " title="EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson" src="http://heatusa.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/epa-lisajackson.jpg" alt="EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson" width="250" height="290" />[/caption]

Whether this is a deliberate effort to get Congress to act or the EPA under head administrator Lisa Jackson just doing her job is unclear.  However, steps taken on the regulatory front could help the Obama Administration next month in its effort to convince other countries that the US is moving on reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.

Today it was <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitol-briefing/2009/11/epa_sends_greenhouse_gases_fin.html">reported that the EPA</a> sent to the White House the final scientific finding on the hazards of greenhouse gas emissions.  This process began during the Bush Administration when the EPA was sued under the Clean Air Act to make a determination about the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/endangerment.htm">hazards of GHGs</a>.  If excessive concentrations are found to endanger public health or welfare, the EPA must regulate them.

Hearings were held and comments were taken earlier this year and all that is needed now is basically White House approval of the scientific findings.  One the finding is official, that could have wide implications on the regulation and give the EPA unprecedented power to restrict emissions.

Many people argue that EPA regulation may not be the most effective way to engage in economy-wide mitigation--and, in fact, there is currently a debate in Congress on whether to strip the EPA of GHG regulatory power under any cap and trade regime.  But, if Congress won't act, the EPA actions are evidence that the Administration will.

Also on the EPA's plate is a <a href="http://www.statejournal.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=69287">potential rule</a> that would require large emitters to make upgrades in efficiency to reduce GHG emissions as part of the standard permitting process.  For instance, power plants would be required to get up-to-date efficiency technology on a regular basis.  This "tailoring rule" would cover sources responsible for about 70% of US emissions, so the mitigation potential could be significant.

The EPA is currently taking <a href="http://www.epa.gov/nsr/">public comment on the tailoring rule</a>, which you can look at <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/home.html#docketDetail?R=EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0517">online</a>.  It is interesting to look at the comments--which are generally updated daily--to see what people are thinking and which interest groups are engaged in coordinated campaigning.   There are quite a few comments from people <a href="http://namissvr.nam.org/minisites/EPA/index.aspx">cutting and pasting boilerplate text</a> from the National Association of Manufacturers who suggest that the EPA is trying to "regulate your life."

My <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/search/Regs/home.html#documentDetail?D=EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0517-0021">favorite so far</a> was from an individual who implored the EPA to "get your jackboots off the throats of the American people!"

There will also be <a href="http://www.epa.gov/nsr/fr/psdgastailoring.pdf">public hearings held next week</a> in Arlington, VA (Wed, Nov.18) and the Chicago suburb of Rosemont (Thurs., Nov. 19).  As of this writing, the only speaker who has registered for the Rosemont meeting is, David Sykuta, a <a href="http://www.grist.org/article/2009-08-21-energy-citizens-rallies-organized-by-industry-lobbyists/">registered lobbyist</a> for the Illinois Petroleum Council.   Anyone can speak, however, and I don't think pre-registration is required.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US On a Climate Diplomatic Offensive</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hjYpNTOfD-tqSC4PwVgkpkgEFlzw">AFP is reporting</a> that the next few weeks leading up to the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen could be marked by a bilateral diplomatic offensive.

President Obama is going to visit China in the next few days and upon returning to Washington, will host the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh at the end of the month.

Obviously both countries are important to coming to an agreement in Copenhagen for action on climate change.

The AFP article also indicates that US Energy Secretary Steven Chu will visit China and India as well to search for common ground.

It will be interesting to see what transpires with the Obama and Chu visits.  Since China, in particular, has said that it wants to reduce its carbon intensity in the mid  term, it seems that the ball is in Obama's court to start talking specifics--something he is reluctant to do without legislation passed in Congress.

Perhaps these meetings will help grease the wheels for something significant to transpire in Copenhagen with Obama providing closed-door promises.  It is difficult to say, but with these high-profile meetings happening in the days prior to the Copenhagen meeting and the recent feelers that Obama put forth about attending the meeting if it looks like progress can be made, climate change certainly will be on the agenda.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>African Leaders Talk Climate While Indigenous Groups Face Eviction</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=467</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The United Nations Environment Programme hosted a meeting of African leaders yesterday in Nairobi to solidify the African position at next month's UN climate talks.

Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga <a href="http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/Kenyanews/Kenya-readies-for-Copenhagen-talks-6484.html">expressed the grievances</a> of developing countries and implored developed countries to their emissions significantly to stave off the worst effects of climate change.

<a href="http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/684864/-/uonahu/-/">Odinga mentioned</a> that Kenya was doing its part to combat climate change--in particular by engaging in reforestation projects in the massive Mau forest.

To show their mettle, they announced <a href="http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/Kenyanews/1,500-families-face-Mau-evictions-6471.html">plans to evict</a> 1,500 "illegal settlers" from the forest who are accused by the government of illegal logging and staying in forest lands without deeds.

I don't profess to be an expert on internal Kenyan politics, but <a href="http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=60905">it appears that</a> the people who are being evicted are <a href="http://www.survivalinternational.org/tribes/ogiek">members of the Ogiek community</a>--an indigenous group with long-standing presence in the forest who have survived for eons by hunting and gathering.

This is something to watch out for as the climate talks proceed in Copenhagen.  One of the main shortcomings of the Kyoto Protocol was the lack of an adequate forest protection mechanism.  During the current negotiations, a stream of talks centered around reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation [REDD] has been initiated.

The idea behind REDD is that there should be some value placed on protecting forests rather than tearing them down.  This sounds good in theory, but the devil will be in the details.

In many parts of the world, the interests of forest dwellers are not represented in the national capitals making decisions on their behalf.  If forests become "monetized" it will not be surprising to see indigenous folk living in a sustainable manner, like the Ogeik being forced from their homes and being restricted in their traditional use of the forest.

The situation in the Mau forest is complicated, for sure.  The <a href="http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/4852">area is supposedly replete</a> with outsiders coming in to log illegally.  But the current struggle of the Ogiek should give pause to REDD negotiators and prompt them to make sure that sustainable forest living is not penalized under any "protection" scheme.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Municipalities Routinely Violate Clean Water Act</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=471</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2009 16:16:17 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The New York Times <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/toxic-waters">continues its excellent series</a> on US water pollution today with an<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/23/us/23sewer.html"> article</a> on the problems with municipal sewer systems.

The essence of the problem is that older cities like New York have antiquated systems and many newer cities have systems whose capacity is inadequate.  During severe rains the systems can't process all of the wastewater and consequently dump untreated sewage into lakes and rivers--often in violation of the Clean Water Act.

In areas with combined sewer systems, the problem is exacerbated since these systems route both wastewater and storm runoff to the pipes.  In severe storms, backups can occur and raw sewage can flood basements and buildings.

The EPA gets criticized in the article for not enforcing the law and municipalities are consequently not penalized for their violations.  Although EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson has pledged to get tougher on violators, municipalities argue that the problems they face stem from a lack of resources and investment to improve systems that have been neglected.  Fines would result in money simply going to the Feds that could otherwise be used to improve systems.

It seems that a good model would be to have aggressive federal action, but to place the focus on helping municipalities develop better ways to improve handling their capacity.  For instance, municipalities could adopt stronger regulations on stormwater management for development or offer incentives for water mitigation techniques like green roofs or permeable pavement.

One subtext that doesn't get explicitly mentioned in the article is climate change.  A major problem with the municipalities discussed in the article is that they are seeing a rise in the number of 100- and 500- year flood events.  This comports with climate change science that suggests more severe storms will occur as the planet gets hotter.  Wastewater treatment, in turn, is generally very energy-intensive.

Thus one could envision that climate change legislation in the US could have adaptation money available for water system upgrades and for mitigation policies.  Green roofs, for instance, decrease runoff and they also act as an insulator, improving a building's energy efficiency; or substituting permeable pavement in a parking lot could both reduce urban heat island effect and reduce runoff.

It is important to recognize that water quality and climate variation are intimately related.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Copenhagen Deal Very Much in Play</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=473</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2009 16:55:37 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is probably forgivable that we have heard reports over the past two weeks of a potential deal in Copenhagen being nearly unachievable.  Various world leaders--including UN General Secretary Ban Ki Moon--started talking about a "politically binding" deal, then US officials expressed skepticism about achieving something substantive.

It appears, perhaps, that these proclamations were premature and that perhaps the only thing we know for sure is that we won't know anything until December 18 (the last scheduled day of the negotiations).  Here are a few reasons to suggest that a deal is very much in play in Copenhagen.
<ul>
	<li>Emerging economies in the Global South are starting to announce domestic mitigation numbers.  Both South Korea and Brazil have said that they will take action to reduce their emissions from business-as-usual levels by 2020.  This is significant since these countries are not required under the Kyoto architecture to commit to any reductions.</li>
	<li>The US is now <a href="http://en.cop15.dk/news/view+news?newsid=2659">talking about</a> setting provisional emissions mitigation targets.  Unlike the European Union and Japan who have publicized their targets, the US has been quiet.  The rationale from the US negotiating team has been that they don't want to repeat the Kyoto experience where the US agreed to targets, but they couldn't get Senate approval to actually make the treaty legally binding.  However,  Todd Stern--the main US climate envoy--broached the idea of presenting targets at Copenhagen based (and perhaps contingent) on the legislation going through Congress.</li>
	<li>There are other factors that I could cite, but the last one is tremendously important: civil society is refusing to back down.  Dave Turnbull--the head of Climate Action Network-International--has a <a href="http://www.grist.org/article/a-week-of-preparation-and-movement/">nice post at Grist.org</a> describing all of the forces coming together in Copenhagen.  His take suggests that the political winds are still in flux, but the political pressure being put on leaders from civil society organizations across the world may be bearing some fruit as more leaders commit to attend the negotiations and the tenor of their statements become less obstructionist.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Australia Carbon Trade Bill Gets Bipartisan Support</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=475</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I admit, I've been a bit delinquent in following the progress of the Australian cap-and-trade legislation.  The <a href="http://cop15.us/?p=144">last we covered it</a> was back in August when the Australian Senate rejected Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's original proposal.

Rudd vowed to re-introduce legislation before UN meetings in Copenhagen.  However, if the legislation failed it would trigger an election under Australia's parliamentary system.  To get legislation passed in the Senate would require making a deal with the climate-unfriendly Liberal Party.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="160" caption="Photo of Kevin Rudd: London Summit"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/londonsummit/"><img title="Kevin Rudd" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3329/3409195678_af30f8b6e0_m.jpg" alt="Photo of Kevin Rudd: London Summit" width="160" height="240" /></a>[/caption]

Fast-forward to today.   <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/nov/24/australia-climate-reform-deal">Rudd announced the details</a> of a compromise bill that has the support of  Liberal leadership.  It is not surprising that the new legislation makes <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSTRE5AN0EJ20091124">significant concessions </a>to the country's coal industry,  by doubling the amount of "transition assistance" ($1.5 bn Aus.) to the coal sector.  The legislation also artificially lowers the price of carbon permits that polluters will be required to purchase once the scheme becomes operational in 2011 and it exempts the entire agricultural sector--a significant producer of emissions.

The problem appears that the scheme may not be very effective at providing the needed incentives to reduce emissions domestically.  In addition to the generous aid given to coal companies, there is apparently a very liberal offset provision which will allow Australia's emitters <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/strong-dollar-will-buy-more-offshore-permits/story-e6frg6zo-1225803463430">to satisfy their obligations </a>by purchasing foreign offsets, which are notoriously difficult to regulate from an effectiveness standpoint.

Apparently these subsidies for industry weren't enough to placate some Liberal opponents of climate legislation.  <a href="http://nqr.farmonline.com.au/news/nationalrural/agribusiness-and-general/political/turnbull-survives-leadership-challenge/1687656.aspx">There appears to be some Liberal stalwarts </a>who want to sack party leader Malcom Turnbull for his capitulation to Rudd.]]></content:encoded>

Their <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2009/11/24/text-of-joint-statement-from-singh-and-obama/">joint statement</a> and press conference had strong words on wanting a "successful," "substantive, "comprehensive" outcome in Copenhagen.

They didn't utter "legally binding," for sure; but their statements were pretty strong given the pessimism that has marked the last few weeks of commentary on Copenhagen's prospects.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Obama to Attend COP-15 Talks in Copenhagen; Significance Uncertain</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=483</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE5AO2F120091125">Reuters is reporting</a> that US President Barack Obama will attend the COP15 climate change talks in Copenhagen prior to his trip to Oslo on 10 December to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.    <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/11/25/obama-travel-copenhagen-climate-change-conference/">According to Fox</a>, Obama will be at the talks on December 9.

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="240" caption="Obama Addresses UN General Assembly; photo: UN"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/un_photo/"><img title="Obama UN" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2693/4081319358_824716d5cb_m.jpg" alt="Obama Addresses UN General Assembly; photo: UN" width="240" height="184" /></a>[/caption]

Many people have been calling for leaders to attend the talks.  The argument is that heads of state and government will bring greater urgency to the negotiations and help push through a more robust deal.  Earlier this month Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/international/2009/November/international_November725.xml&amp;section=international&amp;col=">Rasmussen invited</a> leaders of 192 countries to attend the talks, but the timing for this larger gathering of leaders is scheduled for the end of the second week, during the traditional "high level" segment.

Rasmussen's invitation apparently includes a gala dinner hosted by the Danish queen on Thursday, 17 Dec. followed by negotiations on Friday the 18th--the last day of the conference.

So although Obama will attend COP15, it is unclear with whom he will negotiate.  I am not sure what will be accomplished if he shows up on 9 December, gives a speech, and then doesn't engage with the other <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4917171,00.html?maca=en-en_nr-1893-xml-atom">65 leaders</a> who have already announced their attendance at the high level segment.

In fact, the whole exercise could backfire on the US and contribute to the perception of many critics that they have been dragging their feet during the last year of negotiations.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Australian Senate Rejects Climate Legislation</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=486</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been a rather tumultuous week in Australia in terms of climate politics.

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and opposition leader Malcom Turnbull worked out a deal last week to pass a carbon trading scheme through the Senate, following last August's rejection of similar legislation.  With Senate passage of the bill Rudd could go to Copenhagen poised to be a cooperative party in the effort to reach a global deal.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="179" caption="Former Liberal Party Leader Malcom Turnbull, Photo: Charlie Brewer"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/charliebrewer/"><img title="Turnbull" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3591/3354962584_1fcf140e2b_m.jpg" alt="Former Liberal Party Leader Malcom Turnbull, Photo: Charlie Brewer" width="179" height="240" /></a>[/caption]

However, in response to Turnbull's support for the legislation, back bench Liberal members sacked Turnbull as party leader in favor of Tony Abbott who infamously referred to emissions reduction policy as "absolute crap."  This led to <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c73f6398-dfab-11de-98ca-00144feab49a.html">defeat of the bill</a> in the Senate yesterday, dealing a huge political blow to Rudd who may now have to face a round of elections next year.

The Liberals remain rather unpopular in Australia and the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/nov/27/australia-liberal-party-climate-change">opposition within the party</a> towards the climate legislation does not pose well for the party's prospects in case elections are forced.  But the result can't be good for Rudd who was in Washington <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/obama-and-rudd-to-meet-on-climate-20091126-juo7.html">discussing climate change</a>, among other things, as the turmoil was happening back home.

There will be an <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/12/04/2762235.htm?section=australia">interesting by-election in Higgins</a> over the weekend which is being contested by the Liberals and an insurgent Green candidate.  Without a member of Rudd's Labor party in the race, the Green candidate, Clive Hamilton, could take advantage of negative feelings towards the Liberals for killing climate legislation.

While failure to pass legislation will certainly weaken Australia at the talks in Copenhagen, at least one country doesn't seem particularly phased: the United States.  <a href="http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/ets-failure-doesnt-faze-us-ambassador-20091204-kagj.html">At a speech in Sydney today,</a> US Ambassador to Australia Jeffery Bleich said that the US is "not disappointed" about the Australian failure.  Rudd and Obama, it seems, can commiserate over their lack of influence in their respective senates.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're here on the ground in Copenhagen for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change talks.  I am attending the talks along with a group of students from DePaul University.  I'll be posting here and at <a href="http://cop15.us">cop15.us</a>, which will also feature student posts.

The opening ceremony commenced and negotiations are underway.

One early issue that has been brought up by developing countries quickly and with fury is the future of the Kyoto Protocol.   The African Group walked out of the preliminary negotiations in Barcelona over the issue and it raised its head early on the first day of talks here in Copenhagen.

After an opening ceremony of positive thinking for getting a deal done from the Danish Environment Minister, Connie Hedegaard and UN Climate Change chief Yvo de Boer, it became clear that some of the fundamental obstacles to an agreement need to be resolved.  For two years negotiators have been engaged on a parallel track of talks--one, to figure out to do after the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012; and, two, to engage in a more general discussion of "long term cooperative action" to combat climate change.

The main reason the parallel track was established was due to the United States' failure to ratify Kyoto.  The US objections have primarily been the fact that big-emitting, developing countries like India and China are not required to reduce their emissions and that the US is not keen about the legal implications for a deal that has the weight of a treaty--which would make them more liable for meeting any reduction targets.

At this point, the European Union--which is a party to the Kyoto Protocol--is <a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49572">being accused</a> of joining the US in abandoning Kyoto.   Although the EU has publicly announced that it wants Kyoto to continue, the form in which it does is crucial. If the EU accepts some type of agreement that essentially exempts them from any further commitments under the Protocol, it could create serious opposition from less developed countries, making a deal impossible.]]></content:encoded>

Poulsen was less influenced by the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report than he was by the new Mayan disaster film, 2012.

They played this during the climate talks' opening ceremony.

It's always a little hazardous when policy wonks get involved in creating popular culture.

That maxim was on display later Monday night when the Mayor of Copenhagen hosted a concert and event on climate awareness.  The idea was to mix music and climate talk.  The featured band was the Danish act,<a href="http://nephew.dk/?init=eng.xml"> Nephew</a>.   The warm-up act was Gro Harlem Brundtland--the former Norwegian Prime Minister and head of the panel that wrote the important <a href="http://www.ourcommonfuture.org/">Brundtland Report</a> in the mid-19080s which brought the concept of "sustainable development" to prominence.  After her rather lengthy, given the circumstances, disquisition on climate change and development, the head UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, took the stage.

Yvo barely got into his remarks when he was rather unceremoniously interrupted and pushed off stage with the glib MC rather indecorously said something to the effect of:  "Sorry, Yvo, we need to keep the show going..for the planet."

With that, Nephew--which sounds like a Danish version of Gary Numan--took the stage.  Here's some Nephew for the uninitiated:

		<title>French Climate Minister: Copenhagen Needs to See the &quot;Birth of Planet Policies&quot;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I just saw a brief interview with French Climate Minister, Brice Lalonde, <a href="http://www.iclei.org/index.php?id=10554">conducted by the folks at ICLEI</a>- Local Governments for Sustainability.

The questions didn't get into the specifics of the negotiations here in Copenhagen, but I couldn't help but be impressed by Lalonde's idealism.  He has been an advocate for sustainability and environmental issues for a long time, which included a role in forming the Green Party in Europe.

In the interview today he described the challenge at Copenhagen as one where humanity is trying to invent "planet policy."  This gets at the basic challenge inherent in international negotiations surrounding environmental issues: the challenge of climate change is fundamentally planetary, with costs and benefits being inequitably distributed across the globe.

National governments are set up to address problems that occur within their boundaries, making climate change difficult to address given the nation-state framework.

Lalonde, however, does not think this problem is insurmountable.  He described how the global community has set up global institutions to manage trade and implied that experience should be enough precedent to develop institutions to save the planet.

With the Copenhagen negotiations in full swing, we'll see if Lalonde's vision is prophetic.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Urbanism Eurostyle: Strategies for Mitigation in Cities</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The European Union hosted a seminar at the Copenhagen climate talks today that discussed efforts underway in Sweden to develop sustainable cities.

The presentation included Swedish representatives of various levels of government--from the EU down to municipal officials.  Most compelling were the stories told about sustainable urbanism in the capital city of Stockholm and the southwestern city of Malmö.

Stockholm is the first city to be designated a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital/index_en.htm">European Green Capital</a> by the European Commission.  This award recognizes local efforts to minimize environmental impact.  Deputy Mayor Ulla Hamilton discussed the city's efforts to reach a 3 metric tonne per capita CO2 emissions rate by 2050.  Unlike North American cities where development tends to sprawl out from urban centers, Stockholm's model has been to grow through infill and redevelopment.

One of the city's development planners, Olle Cyren, described two development efforts: the first was <span><a href="http://www.hammarbysjostad.se/glashusett/">Hammarby Sjöstad</a>, which is looking to emit 50% less GHGs than a comparable development from 1990.  The second example discussed was the <a href="http://www.stockholmroyalseaport.com/">Royal Seapor</a>t, which is one of the largest real estate developments in Europe with 10,000 residential units and room for 30,000 workers.   This site is attempting to reach a per capita level of emissions of 2.5 tonnes--as a point of comparison, the US per capita level is about 20 tonnes!</span>

<span>The final presenter was Anders Rubin a Deputy Mayor from the city of Malm</span>ö.  <span>Malm</span>ö is situated across the Öresund sound from Copenhagen.  Rubin charted the history of <span>Malm</span>ö from its heyday as a shipping port and center of industry in the post-War era to a victim of deindustrialization where during the first three years of the 1990s the city lost a third of its jobs.

<span>With a depressed economy and a shrinking population Malm</span>ö more or less had a "blank slate" for redevelopment, which city leaders chose to pursue with a decidedly green agenda.

They were helped quite a bit by the building of the Öresund Bridge in 2000, which improved transport links to Copenhagen.  The inevitable growth that accompanies a large infrastructure project like a bridge was coordinated with the introduction of green technology.  According to Rubin, half of Sweden's solar electricity is produced in <span>Malm</span>ö and he described a strategy of making rooftop solar panels especially conspicuous to provide the city with a distinct identity.  The city also boasts 40% of its population reporting that they commute to school or work by cycling.

These types of examples contradict the false idea that economic and urban growth MUST follow a high-carbon model.  Lessons learned from cases in Sweden can be especially valuable for US cities as they start to develop low-carbon policies.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Negotiations Stall Somewhat in Copenhagen</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=518</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday the big media story at the UN climate talks in Copenhagen was the leaking of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/08/copenhagen-climate-change">Dutch Draft</a>.  The Guardian--which broke the story--ran the headline that the leak sent the talks into "disarray" just hours after their release.

The draft text basically does away with the legal framework of the Kyoto Protocol and funnels all adaptation and development aid through the World Bank--non-starters with the Global South.

Many observers, however, were less hysterical.  Tan Copsey at China Dialogue <a href="http://www.chinadialogue.net/weblogs/1/weblog_posts/8">has a good post</a> saying that the draft text is just part of the business of negotiation.  Parties start out with unreasonable claims, then during the process of deliberation they "give" on their demands to come to an agreement.

That is not to say that the negotiations have been bereft of tension.  During today's session there was a <a href="http://unfccc.int/documentation/documents/advanced_search/items/3594.php?rec=j&amp;priref=600005256">proposal</a> on the table by Tuvalu which would establish a new "protocol" whose goal is to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees centigrade and push the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to 350ppm.  This is the target that many environmentalists are pushing for and one that is required for Tuvalu and many other small island nations to stave off climate disaster.

Tuvalu's proposal was immediately opposed by Saudi Arabia, China, India and a host of oil-rich states who equated a new protocol with an abandonment of the Kyoto accord.  The idea that the Tuvalu proposal takes Kyoto off the table is little hard to swallow, as there are numerous points in the draft that identify the precedence of Kyoto.  The opposition is probably more predicated on the fact that non-Annex 1 parties (like China and India) don't want to open a new can of worms by even talking about a new protocol.  Kyoto works well for them as they are under no legal obligation to reduce emissions.

The debate got contentious enough that Tuvalu insisted on suspending the talks.  Currently, the Danish environment minister Connie Hedegaard is working to break the stalemate.

Activists are out in force, trying to express support for Tuvalu's position.  It culminated in an action outside the plenary hall a couple of hours ago.  At this point it is difficult to see the precise portent this leaked draft may have, but it is probably safe to say there will be more drama before the national leaders arrive here next week.

Here is a short video shot by "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/dostafinski">dostafinski</a>" outside the plenary:

		<title>US Interior Secretary Salazar Gives Mixed Signals on Federal Lands and Coal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday the US Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, gave a <a href="http://www.doi.gov/news/09_News_Releases/121009.html">speech</a> at the UN Climate Change conference in Copenhagen.  He is <a href="http://cop15.state.gov/">part of a cavalcade</a> of high-level administration officials coming to Copenhagen in advance of President Obama's participation in the high-level segment of negotiations next week.

Salazar laid out the administration's standard line on climate change, asserting that "the United States understands the danger of climate change poses for the world" and laid out the vision of his department has for facing this challenge.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="288" caption="US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar at COP15"]<img title="Ken Salazar" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/SyHsx49XD5I/AAAAAAAADnA/Us3bMipbT9U/s288/Picture%20024.jpg" alt="US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar at COP15" width="288" height="216" />[/caption]

The Interior Department is a key government agency in addressing the climate problem due to the large amount of land that falls under its purview.  Much of that land is in the Southwestern US in areas that could be ripe for renewable energy projects using wind and solar.

The most curious part of his talk was when he discussed "carbon capture."  He rightly mentioned the large swaths of forest land that need to be preserved to act as a carbon sink for sequestration and announced the release of a study by the US Geologic Survey that <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=2362&amp;from=rss_home">contends</a> "the U.S. hypothetically have the potential to store an additional 3-7 billion metric tons of carbon in forests, if agricultural lands were to be used for planting forests. This potential is equivalent to 2 to 4 years of America’s current CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions from burning fossil fuels."

But more troubling was his stance on the controversial practice of carbon capture and storage.  This involves taking carbon emissions from a point source and injecting it into the ground to keep out of the atmosphere.  This is largely an untested technology that hasn't been implemented to any significant degree on a commercial scale.   Issues like transporting the gassified CO2, and the permanence of its storage have not been adequately resolved.  Coal companies, however, are counting on carbon capture and storage's (CCS) viability to continue burning "clean coal" in a carbon-regulated environment.

Salazar was pushed by a questioner on the problems inherent in maintaining a coal-based energy policy given the problems with CCS.  Salazar expressed confidence in the development of CCS technology and suggested that carbon could be stored on public lands.  But this stance fails to look at the problems of coal extraction, which can disrupt landscapes and water quality when "mountaintop removal" techniques are used.   Obama has been a consistent advocate of "clean coal" without, so Salazar's position isn't surprising.  However, one would hope that the administration would take a more systematic analysis of CCS' drawbacks.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Draft Negotiation Text Released in Copenhagen Amid Protests</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The negotiations here in Copenhagen have been proceeding rather slowly as fissures between the Alliance of Small Island States and the large developing countries have forced some delay in discussions.  The small island nation of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BB0QU20091212">Tuvalu has been pushing</a> for a new, legally binding protocol which would keep global warming to a 1.5 degree level and keep the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere at 350ppm.  India and China are against even discussing the Tuvalu proposal given their satisfaction with the existing legal framework of the Kyoto Protocol, which does not require either country to restrict their emissions.

While the chair of the main Conference of the Parties has been trying to sort out a way to bridge this impasse, a perhaps more important <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/application/pdf/draftcoretext.pdf">draft text was released today</a> [.pdf] by the chair of the Ad hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action [AWG-LCA].  The AWG-LCA is where the US has been concentrating its efforts towards coming up with a new global climate deal.   The US administration has said that they will not sign the Kyoto Protocol, so the general sentiment among Europe, Japan, Australia, and Canada is that some new framework has to be developed that China and India can support.

The draft text assumes the continuation of Kyoto and gives some numbers to consider next week as it pertains to mitigating emissions: acceptance of either 1.5 or 2 degrees of warming; reduction of global emissions by somewhere between 50-95 percent of 1990 levels by 2050; requiring developed countries to reduce GHGs by somewhere between 75-95 percent by 2050.

It also offers legally binding midterm mitigation targets for developed countries: between 25-45 percent from 1990 levels by 2020.  Developing countries are encouraged to reduce their emissions by 15-30 from business as usual levels by 2020.

Although some items like the institutional mechanism to funnel financing to the least developed countries for mitigation are unclear in the draft, it certainly seems like a fair text and is one which China and India will likely support.

The United States, Japan, the European Union, however, <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20091212/copenhagen_talks_091212/20091212/">criticized the draft</a>, with US negotiator Jonathan Pershing saying it "doesn't work."

Delegates will likely be working furiously in the next three days to get something on the table before ministers and heads of state descend on Copenhagen for the final days of the talks next week.

In the interim, thousands of people are marching in Copenhagen to put pressure on delegates in the Bella Center to conclude a deal.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Targeting Buildings to Mitigate Emissions</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=528</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Friday, Finland and the European Union hosted a side event at the United Nations climate talks on the building sector.  Finnish Minister of Housing, Jan Vapaavuori was a featured speaker and he made the point that globally, 40% of all energy is used by buildings and that their greenhouse gas emissions account for 30% of total GHGs.  He made the important point that--for developed countries, at least--the crucial issue is dealing with old buildings.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="500" caption="Photo of Jan Vapaavuori: Megapolis 2024"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30909947@N06/"><img title="Jan Vapaavuori" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3122/2897756903_29fbe19ee4.jpg" alt="Photo of Jan Vapaavuori: Megapolis 2024" width="500" height="333" /></a>[/caption]

Vapaavuori's fellow panelist, Sylvie Lemmet of the United Nations Environment Programme, pointed out that 95% of the 2050 building stock is already built in developed countries.

This is significant for cities that are trying to reduce their emissions since developed countries are the ones that need to make the greatest emissions cuts by 2050.  While it is relatively simple to regulate building efficiency prior to construction through the deployment of strong building ordinances, reaching already-constructed structures is a bit more challenging.

The other important point made by Vapaavuori is that building operation is more important than building construction in terms of emissions.  This is essential to think about from the policy perspective as  most urban policies--in the form of building codes or development credit--once again target new construction instead of renovation.

Much of the discussion focused on trying to figure out ways to create incentives for low-emission building renovation.  The problem now is that there is a significant up-front cost for high-efficiency upgrades.  While the upgrades pay for themselves in the long-run, consumers may not have access to the initial capital to invest in the upgraded equipment.  Furthermore, in highly mobile countries like the United States, homeowners may only be thinking of living in a house for a short time, making investment unwise.

It would be relatively easy to leverage the savings generated over the life of a high-efficiency building enhancement to finance the requisite up-front investment.  Some municipalities in California do this sort of thing where they establish a bond district that residents can tap into if they want to make an upgrade.  The municipality fronts the money and then property owners pay back the city at a realtively low interest rate and monthly cost over several decades.  If they sell the house, the new owner assumes the outstanding debt obligation.  Cities are already using these sorts of financing schemes to raise money for things like alley pavement and sidewalk construction.

A federal program providing the capital in this way would be a perfect clean energy stimulus scheme.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Demonstrations at UN Climate Talks As Copenhagen High-Level Meeting Begins</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=533</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Prime Ministers, Presidents, and other leaders descended on Copenhagen's Bella Center today to try and develop some sort of agreement as part of the UN-sponsored climate talks.

The high-level segment, however, began at the expense of the "low-level" delegates.  Yesterday, despite knowing for months that upwards of 35,000 delegates were registered to attend the negotiations, the UN climate change secretariat instituted a reduced-access policy for NGO delegates.  Most NGOs received one third of their original allocations for Tuesday and Wednesday, with NGOs essentially shut out of the conference for the final two days.  People generally understand the enhanced security measures needed for when heads of state arrive, but the restrictions were the culmination of a week of rather poorly-organized logistics.  Our group arrived on December 6th and had a relatively painless experience getting accredited.  However, on Monday--before the restrictions were introduced--new registrants <a href="http://www.nigerianbestforum.com/generaltopics/?p=24391">had to wait hours</a> <a href="http://europeanperspective.blogspot.com/2009/12/copenhagen-roundup.html">before</a> <a href="http://yagamiwebsite.blogspot.com/2009/12/climate-change-talks-in-copenhagen.html">getting</a> their badges.

Although the reduced allocation seemed to function on Tuesday, for some reason the secretariat shut out ALL NGOs from entering the building beginning around noon.  This was preceded by a selective "deactivation" of NGO badges from the environmental groups Avaaz and <a href="http://www.foe.co.uk/campaigns/climate/news/copenhagen_blog_staygo_22341.html">Friends of the Earth</a>.  This is really significant--not only because it is unjust to de-accredit specific groups and that the text of the treaty that serves as the basis of the talks specifically "encourage[s] the widest participation in this process," but also because civil society groups tend to act as a supportive voice for many of the smaller countries.

Many small countries can't afford to bring a huge staff and rely on NGOs to monitor action, manage media access, and explain their positions to the greater global public.  Youth activists, especially, coordinate rapid response actions in the hall so all participants remember the justice issues at stake in the negotiations.  When these groups are arbitrarily excluded from the process, time and resources are spent assailing the process instead of being used to help push for substantive measures to be included in a deal.

The culmination of these decisions is not pretty.  After the UN restricted NGO access, activists and others marched to the Bella Center where they were met with police violence, which was filmed by <a href="http://cydcopenhagen.org/">CYDCopenhagen</a>:

		<title>Negotiations Stall as Ministers Address the UN Climate Change Talks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Negotiators in a key sub-group of the UN climate negotiations in Copenhagen worked through the early morning today which culminated in the release of a <a href="http://unfccc.int/documentation/documents/advanced_search/items/3594.php?rec=j&amp;priref=600005642&amp;suchen=n">draft text</a> that is supposed to serve as the basis of an agreement for world leaders to sign when they arrive here on Friday.

As the iteration which appeared on Saturday, the latest text makes little progress on key issues of mitigation for developed and developing countries while saying little about financing schemes for developing countries to adapt to climate change and shift to low-carbon technologies .

The consequence is that the high-level ministers will now have to get involved in the heavy lifting aspect of the negotiating process if any sort of agreement is to be signed by world leaders on Friday.

In other developments, <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2009/12/16/text_of_sen_kerrys_speech_at_cop15?mode=PF">Senator John Kerry addressed the conference</a> in what amounted to a campaign speech for the US position.  My impression has been that Kerry has a lot of respect amongst delegates for his long-standing interest in the climate change issue.  However, his speech was a bit troubling for the negotiations.

He spent quite a bit of time dispelling climate skeptics--which was clearly geared towards domestic consumption.  When you've been at a climate change conference in Europe for over a week, it is pretty easy to forget that skeptics actually exist!  His impassioned plea for following the science wasn't really needed inside the COP, so what it told me is that his Senate bill must be in at least a little trouble--although he equally forcefully said at the end of his speech that the US would pass climate legislation by the end of next year, with the Senate taking up the issue in the spring.

I would have to concur with <a href="http://www.chinadialogue.net/weblogs/1/weblog_posts/42">Tan Copsey at China Dialogue</a>, that the most troubling part of his speech were lightly veiled attacks at the Chinese position in the talks.  He expressed a bit of protectionism by talking about "dumping high carbon" products into the US market.  Additionally, he focused heavily on the idea that countries must have "measurable, reportable, and verifiable" emissions targets.

This is another swipe at China.   The US seems quite skeptical about China's recent pronouncements that they will reduce their emissions from business-as-usual projections and want to have some assurance that emissions mitigation can be quantified.  China, of course, is hesitant to commit to reductions in the first place and wants to maintain as much flexibility as possible in the negotiations.

Thus with Kerry's rather hard line speech and the minimal movement on the negotiating text, the only thing clear about the next couple of days is that they will be unpredictable and probably contentious.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>World Leaders Arrive in Copenhagen, Talks Continue Behind Closed Doors</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As world leaders poured into Copenhagen, negotiations continued Thursday in an effort to salvage some type of agreement from the UN-sponsored climate talks.

No new negotiating drafts were officially released, although <a href="http://live.tcktcktck.org/climate-voice/leaked-document-secretariat-550ppm-3-degrees-rise">a leaked document</a> from the UN Secretariat has been circulating amongst NGO observers suggests the current policies on the table will only limit global warming to 3 degrees centigrade from pre-industrial levels.

This, obviously, means that much more work needs to be done if <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8143291.stm">the pledge</a> by developed countries to limit global warming to 2 degrees is to be realized.

Given the non-public manner of the negotiations--nearly all NGO observers have been kicked out of the conference venue--it is difficult to ascertain precisely how the negotiations are developing.

Some countries, however, are beginning to show their cards on key issues.  Most notably, yesterday, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledged that her country would contribute to the <a href="http://euobserver.com/9/29175">$100 billion/year aid fund</a> for developing countries that was first introduced by Gordon Brown earlier this year.

Key issues about the actual amount each developing country should contribute and how the funds will be distributed remain unresolved.

Aside from the financing pledge, very little else was revealed yesterday.  This is highly problematic since the consensus of observers suggests that <em>something</em> will have to be produced from these meetings given the fact that over 100 heads of state are now at the negotiations.  Simply in order for world leaders to save face, some document will be produced.  The real problem is that any document or agreement at this point is not likely to seriously address the pressing policy issues at hand.

The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/19/science/earth/19climate.html">New York Times is reporting</a> that upon arriving in Copenhagen,  Obama immediately went into a closed door meeting with the leaders of major economies instead of giving his planned public address to all delegates.  It will be interesting to see what comes out of this meeting and how--in particular--the smallest, poorest nations that are likely excluded from the backdoor meeting react.  Nations like Tuvalu have been steadfast in pushing for transparency and a strong deal.  If a weak deal emerges from behind closed doors, I would expect Tuvalu and other small island nations to continue their vigorous objections.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Barack Obama gave a pretty stern <a href="http://cop15.us/?p=843">speech</a> to other leaders at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen a few minutes ago.

Unfortunately, he yielded no ground that would make a fair, ambitious, and binding deal forthcoming from the deliberations over the last two weeks.

The main sticking point for Obama is Chinese resistance to agree to any specific cuts that will be verifiable to an international body.

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao preceded Obama and basically said that China will make cuts from business as usual, and that they should be taken at their word.

President Lula de Silva of Brazil was sandwiched in between Obama and Wen and was quite impassioned in expressing frustration about the little progress seen thus far.  As a way to show constructive action, Lula even indicated that Brazil would provide financial assistance to low income countries to develop in a low-carbon manner--a move unprecedented given Brazil's position as a developing country itself.

These early speeches continue to dim the hope that anything substantive will come out of the negotiations]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Copenhagen Summit Ends in Failure</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The UN climate change talks in Copenhagen ended in a dramatic flurry of activity, diplomacy, and negotiation early Saturday.  The activity, however, did not translate into any significant momentum towards resolving the major impediments to a truly global response to the climate crisis.

The main takeaway from the talks was the <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_15/application/pdf/cop15_cph_auv.pdf">"Copenhagen Accord,"</a> [.pdf] a document largely negotiated by the large emitters, including the United States, China, India and Brazil.  The details of how the accord was negotiated are still sketchy, although some the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/20/copenhagen-climate-global-warming">initial</a> <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8fb70c48-ed9b-11de-ba12-00144feab49a.html">reporting</a> suggests that world leaders were actually going line-by-line through the text--an activity normally reserved for lower level diplomats.  Interestingly, it seemed as if <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gHb77YA9Gn1q8QwopmdlPEITMjUA">China &amp; India were savvy</a> in keeping the EU and the US at bay.  Chinese Premier <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/science/earth/20accord.html">Wen Jiabao sent his underlings</a> into meetings with Western leaders and apparently rejected both the EU offer of reducing its emissions by 30% by 2020 from 1990 levels and the general developed country commitment of an 80% reduction by 2050 under the questionable guise that by 2050 they will be considered "developed" and subject to reductions.

After the accord was endorsed late Friday night by the few countries engaged in its drafting, it needed to be presented to the larger "conference of the parties" to the UN climate treaty.  The floor debate began around 3:00am and was <a href="http://www5.cop15.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/cop15/templ/archive.php?id_kongressmain=1&amp;theme=unfccc#">quite rancorous</a>.  There was significant opposition from Latin American countries and small island nations who were cut out of the accord's drafting.

Decisions under the climate treaty generally require consensus from all participating countries and at one point it seemed as if the conference would break up without considering the accord.  Apparently the head UK climate negotiator, Ed Miliband stepped in to defend the accord and the conference wound up "noting" the accord as opposed to "supporting" or "endorsing" it.

Such a tepid response sullies the accord's significance within the context of the UN decision making framework.

So, what does the Copenhagen Accord say?

First, it is a political agreement, so there are no legal obligations on the part of signatories to follow its directives.

Second, the accord does say that "the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius."  This is in keeping with other political proclamations over the past year by developed countries--in particular the G8.  However the use of the word "should"--rather than "shall"--doesn't imply a significant level of commitment.

Third, instead of a timetable for a globally-binding treaty, the accord simply says that "we should cooperate in achieving the peaking of global and national emissions as soon as possible."  Again, no "shall," and more significantly, no mention in the accord of translating its framework into a legally-binding treaty--an outcome of Copenhagen that was hoped for by many before the talks began.

Fourthly, the accord asks both developed and developing countries to submit their own national emissions targets by 31 January 2010 to include in the accord.  Significantly, developing countries' mitigation targets "will be subject to their domestic measurement, reporting, and verification" procedures.  This represents a strike against the US position, which had insisted throughout the talks that China and India--in particular--needed to be subject to international "MRV" procedures.  The accord does say, however, that if a developing country is receiving international financing for a specific mitigation action then that particular action needs to be subject to international monitoring.

Fifth, the accord does recognize the importance of forest conservation and endorses an "immediate establishment of a mechanism" to provide financing for stopping deforestation.

Sixth, the accord provides specific numbers for financing from developed countries to developing countries to deal with adaptation and mitigation.  The commitment is collective--meaning the specific breakdown of each country's share has not been established--and will be $30 billion for three years.  By 2020, the number should rise to $100 billion per year.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/21/business/energy-environment/21iht-green21.html">These aggregate numbers are lower</a> than amounts discussed before the conference and the specific mechanisms on how money will be allocated are unresolved.

The accord discusses setting up a "Copenhagen Green Climate Fund" that will monitor climate aid and should be accountable to the parties to the UN convention.  Although I'm not a lawyer, it is not clear to me what the significance of the parties' lack of clear endorsement of the Copenhagen Accord might have on the governance of this fund.

Finally, the accord calls for its implementation to be completed by 2015 and a future "consideration of strengthening of the long-term goal referencing various matters presented by the science, including in relation to temperature rises of 1.5 degrees Celsius."  This, obviously, was a rather torpid attempt to placate small island states and the growing body of scientists and activists who argue that the risks of accepting a 2 degree rise in global temperature are too great.

The summation of the Copenhagen Accord has been best expressed by Kim Carstensen of the World Wildlife Fund, <a href="http://www.wwf.org.uk/news_feed.cfm?3605/Copenhagen-half-baked-and-unclear">who calls it</a> "half-baked and unclear."

It doesn't really resolve anything, but brings up even more questions about how the problem of global climate change can be addressed.

Some of these questions include:  If the signatories to the declaration really want to keep the planet from warming 2 degrees, what are they going to do to see that goal realized? What will happen if/when, at the end of January after countries present their mitigation goals, it becomes apparent that the voluntary commitments will be insufficient to stave off harmful global warming?

The accord says that it should be fully implemented by 2015.  This is also the year that <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5izYrubhpeFvOKCRrZmWSYWCkPoRg">IPCC head Rajendra Pachauri said</a> that global emissions need to peak in order to stay within the 2 degree warming threshold.  How can can emissions peak by 2015 given the leisurely timeline for implementation?

What is the future of the UN climate change convention?  If the Copenhagen Accord is the product of a backroom deal that fundamentally eclipses the Kyoto Protocol and the larger UNFCCC process, does this mean that the effort for a legally binding treaty is effectively over?  Regardless of what happens to the UNFCCC, how can differences in the US, EU, China and Indian positions be resolved if we are to live on a planet safe from the risks associated with escalated global temperatures?

Is the financing adequate to help the most distressed peoples of the world avoid catastrophe?  The numbers in the accord don't seem to add up and are not nearly ambitious enough to deal with the crises many less developed countries are experiencing right now in their struggles to adapt to changing climatic conditions.

These questions were the ones that were <em>supposed</em> to have been resolved at Copenhagen.  The fact that nothing has been resolved is testament to a failure in leadership of many countries involved and especially those who pushed through the accord, namely the US, China, and India.

The next few weeks will be crucial.  Pressure from civil society on national leaders will be essential if actual progress can be made on mitigation.  If the numbers presented on 1 February don't hold up to scrutiny, each of the signatories needs to be quite explicit on how the international community will actually address the reality of the science.

That leaves the last unresolved question which comes out Copenhagen, namely the future of civil society in pushing for a fair, binding, and ambitious deal.  The UNFCCC and Danish government's failure to adequately accommodate civil society in Copenhagen leaves a bitter taste for many who had hopes for the talks.  Expelling civil society observers from the Bella Center for the last days of the conference undoubtedly made it easier for the major emitters to push through a "half-baked" accord.  It will be difficult, but the many civil society groups involved in climate policy will have to regroup and redouble their efforts to pressure national leaders to develop an actual deal.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Climate Outlook 2010</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been a month since the UN summit  in Copenhagen ended amidst discord and uncertainty about the state  of global climate policy.  The dust has settled somewhat and we've had  some time to reflect.  So where do we stand at the beginning of  2010?

For the two years leading up to Copenhagen,  the expectation was that the meeting would culminate with a solid framework  for a new climate treaty based on the latest scientific evidence and  poised to reform the shortcomings of the Kyoto Protocol.

Instead, the meeting ended with little  substantive progress and a vague, last-minute, face-saving political  document (the "<a href="http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_15/application/pdf/cop15_cph_auv.pdf">Copenhagen Accord</a>") on which key countries  appear to be relying for action in the coming year.

The Accord asks countries to submit  their voluntary emissions reduction targets for the year 2020 by 31  January.  Unlike the Kyoto Protocol which only called on developed  countries to reduce their emissions, the Copenhagen commitment will  include reductions from "business as usual" by key developing  countries.

On the issue of insuring that countries  stick to their commitments and engage in measurable and verifiable reductions,  the accord asks countries to develop domestic procedures, eschewing  an international standard.

The accord also discusses a financial  mechanism by which the rich countries responsible for atmospheric greenhouse  gas buildup can help poorer countries meet the immediate challenges  they face in adapting to a changing planet.

While the accord is commendable to the  extent that it gets countries--including the emerging economies of India,  China, and Brazil--to offer mid-term emissions reduction targets, its  voluntary, non-binding nature makes the entire enterprise quite precarious.

Thus, as we move forward in 2010, there  will be some key things on which to focus to see if adequate global  solutions to the climate problem can be developed.

First, it will be key to <a href="http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/policy/copenhagen-accord-commitments">see which countries  formally sign</a> on to the Copenhagen Accord, if they sign on by the 31  January deadline, and the nature of their commitments.  On Wednesday, UN climate chief, <a href="http://www.euractiv.com/en/climate-environment/eu-sticks-climate-pledges-amid-soft-un-deadline-concerns/article-189133">Yvo De Boer called the 31st a "soft deadline,"</a> suggesting that some of the countries which pushed for the accord may not even be willing to meet this modest provision.  Last week in a speech in Washington, US negotiator <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jan/14/climate-talks-un-sidelined">Jonathan Pershing said countries were working on their commitments</a>, including the US; but he gave no indication as to whether the US will meet the deadline.

Much of the holdup in the US brings us to the second key process to watch out for in 2010: the climate bill in Congress.  The Obama Administration has used the need to get a comprehensive climate bill through Congress as an excuse for its coyness in its failure to agree to bold emissions reductions targets.  The logic on the surface made sense: Kyoto has been ineffective because of US lack of participation and the lack of participation was due to Congressional rejection of the Clinton Administration's targets which were presented to the international community without Congressional approval.

Obama's representatives have said that they want to be able to stand by any numbers they put on the negotiating table.  However, at this point, passing ANY significant legislation through the US Senate is looking to be difficult.  Although Obama's Democratic party has majorities in both houses of Congress, they don't appear willing to exert any political muscle on potentially controversial legislation.  As I write this, the future of the year-long effort at health care reform appears in doubt solely because the Democrats lost one seat from their Senate majority.

If the Democrats aren't willing to push through their health care bill, there is even less hope for climate legislation given the fact that there are key Democrats who are not excited about reducing emissions.  I'm not sure where this leaves us on the international side of the negotiations; but where ever it is, it is not a good place.

Thirdly, over the next few months we will begin to see where the UNFCCC fits into this uncertain environment.  In <a href="http://csis.org/event/post-copenhagen-outlook">last week's speech</a>, Pershing was quite dismissive of the UN process.  He seemed to push the idea that the "major economies forum" might be where the action is in getting things done.  On the one hand this makes sense, given that we need key developing countries to make reductions from business-as-usual to stay within the global warming limits that the science demands.  However, the major economies forum leaves many important constituencies out of the process.  Small island nations, poor African nations, indigenous peoples, NGOs, and global civil society have no seat at this exclusive table--while the UNFCCC, with all its flaws, does offer a modicum of accessibility.

In his <a href="http://unfccc2.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/100120_pressconference/templ/ovw.php?id_kongressmain=104">news conference</a> yesterday, UN climate chief Yvo de Boer looked positively exhausted.  While he did his best to put a positive spin on the Copenhagen Accord, it was not convincing.  In the immediate weeks prior to Copenhagen, people were hoping at the very least that a specific timetable for a binding agreement would come out of the talks.  What actually emerged was a political agreement with a loose time line and voluntary targets.

Many of the key players behind the Copenhagen Accord--including President Obama--have said they view the accord as a step towards an agreement.  But the question that needs to be answered is what kind and size of step?

There are many other loose ends stemming from Copenhagen that need to be scrutinized--the whole financing scheme, for example.  But for now, these are just a few things we'll be keeping our eye on over the next few months.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Key Developing Country Environment Ministers Meet in India</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Environment ministers from the BASIC countries--Brazil, South Africa, India, China--met in New Delhi over the weekend to coordinate their responses to international climate change negotiations in advance of the 31 January deadline for parties to communicate their emissions reductions strategies to the UNFCCC.

The meeting ended with a <a href="http://www.hindu.com/nic/2010draft.htm">joint statement</a> that reasserts their support for both the UN process and the Copenhagen Accord which has a tenuous and uncertain relationship to the global climate regime.  The countries call on the Prime Minister of Denmark to convene five meetings leading up to the big, COP 16, meeting in Mexico.   But they also indicated their intentions to submit emissions reductions targets by Sunday's deadline.

Perhaps more significantly was their emphasis on the Accord's immediate $10bn annual pledge for adaptation in developing countries.  In <a href="http://www.upi.com/Science_News/Resource-Wars/2010/01/26/Chinas-odd-climate-change-remark/UPI-85031264532972/">news reports</a> several of the environment ministers pointed to that pledge as a test of developed countries' seriousness.

On related note, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jan/25/climate-aid-uk-funding">Guardian reports today</a> that the United Kingdom is contemplating reallocating money from existing overseas aid budgets to finance climate change adaptation.  This, of course, is objectionable to developing countries who insist that climate assistance should be above and beyond existing aid.

Things aren't much better in the United States where the climate envoy <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idINIndia-45679120100125?sp=true">Jonathan Pershing said yesterday</a> that the government is "currently looking at the financing in the budget" suggesting that the "fast track" funding is far from immanent.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Countries Begin Offering Copenhagen Accord Targets</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With Sunday's deadline fast approaching for countries to officially offer their emissions reductions targets under the Copenhagen Accord, we are starting to get a glimpse into how the parties to the UN climate convention are interpreting the rather vague document.

The Accord was a deal brokered in the final minutes of last month's Copenhagen conference by the leaders of the major emitters.  It was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/23/copenhagen-summit-accord-silver-lining">nearly derailed</a> in the formal session at Copenhagen.  The compromise which was hashed out at that session was not a full-fledged endorsement, but merely a reflection that the Copenhagen Accord was "noted" by signatories to the UN climate treaty.

I won't get into the arcana of UN climate decision-making, but the significance of "noting" the decision has been unclear.  Is it a "legal" document?  Are countries under some obligation to meet its dictates?

Underscoring the uncertainty of the document, the head of the UN climate secretariat, Yvo de Boer, had to send out a <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://unfccc.int/files/parties_and_observers/notifications/application/pdf/100125_noti_clarification.pdf">letter</a> to parties stressing that the Copenhagen Accord does "not have any legal standing in the UNFCCC process."

Therefore, it will be interesting to see how countries themselves interpret the Accord in order to get a sense for its significance.

Meeting the Sunday deadline for submitting emissions reductions targets to the UN is one way to gauge the seriousness of countries.  Last week, de Boer called the 31 Jan. deadline<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8471593.stm"> "soft,"</a> raising concern that it will be ignored.

As far as I can tell, the major emitters (aside from <a href="http://is.gd/79wAb">South Korea</a>) have not yet presented their commitments to the UN.

What is interesting though, is that some of the smaller countries--e.g. <a href="http://is.gd/79vyW">Marshall Islands</a>, <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/application/pdf/singaporecphaccord_app2_280110.pdf">Singapore</a>, <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/application/pdf/samoacphaccord_200110.pdf">Samoa</a>, <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/application/pdf/bangladeshcphaccord_250110.pdf">Bangladesh</a> --are insisting that the Copenhagen Accord be a step on the path towards a legally binding treaty.  We are seeing this in their pre-Jaunuary 31 communications.

Even a major emitter like the United States <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-during-press-availability-copenhagen">ostensibly wants</a> a legally binding treaty.  But how this plays out within the context of the existing UN framework is extremely uncertain.

One thing that has never been resolved--although it was supposed to have been dealt with in Copenhagen--is the future of the Kyoto Protocol.  Fast-growing developing countries like  China and India have been reluctant to give up on Kyoto since its architecture does not obligate them to reduce emissions.

The key advantage of the Copenhagen Accord is that it does ask these emergent economies to plan for some commitment to reductions from business-as-usual levels.   Earlier this week the BASIC countries (Brazil, South Africa, India &amp; China) released a <a href="http://www.hindu.com/nic/2010draft.htm">statement</a> indicating that they want the Kyoto discussions to continue, while simultaneously expressing their interest in signing on to the Copenhagen Accord.

At some point a different architecture is going to have to be developed.  Kyoto is binding (for those who have ratified it) but ineffective.  Copenhagen is voluntary, but it is still too early to judge its effectiveness.  Thus, these early communications from countries could be key in determining the ultimate efficacy of the Copenhagen Accord.

If we see a large number of smaller, developing countries highlighting in their communications that the Copenhagen Accord is part of a process leading to a legally-binding treaty, one way of interpreting it would be that these countries are seeking to maintain the Kyoto architecture since Kyoto is the main legal expression currently in force.

It will be interesting to see how some of the larger emitters respond.  For instance, it is not clear whether South Korea mentioned anything about their commitments being part of the effort to forge a treaty.

If you get key countries like the US, Mexico, Indonesia, the EU, Japan, excluding mention of a treaty in their communications, it may not bode well for the UN negotiations later this year in Mexico.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US Submits Copenhagen Accord Target</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=557</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After I wrote my <a href="http://hughbartling.com/?p=555">earlier post</a> on countries that submitted their emissions targets under the Copenhagen Accord, I visited the <a href="http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/policy/copenhagen-accord-commitments">tally sheet</a> maintained by the US Climate Action Network and noticed that they had a <a href="http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/resource-database/us-inscription-to-the-unfccc-on-the-copenhagen-accord">copy of the official US letter</a>.

Dated today, the letter commits the US to a 17% reduction in greenhouse gases from 2005 levels by 2020 "in conformity with anticipated US energy and climate legislation, recognizing that the final target will be reported to the Secretariat in light of enacted legislation."

There was also no mention of the Copenhagen Accord fitting into a legal process or treaty-building exercise.

The letter does say that the US expects other countries to meet the 31 January deadline for reporting their emissions under the Accord, contradicting Yvo de Boer's description of Sunday as a "soft " deadline.

The US response is not a surprise.  The Obama Administration gives itself an "out" if Congress fails to pass legislation or passes a climate bill with a weaker target.

Failure to mention steps beyond the Accord suggests to me that the US is not enthusiastic about the viability of the UN process.  But the reiteration of the 31 January deadline means that the US doesn't want other countries to delay and that they want to be able to point to positive steps towards addressing global climate change.

Like I said, none of this is surprising; but it shows us how the battle lines are beginning to solidify and what to expect in the way of points of contention as international negotiations continue over the next few months.

On the domestic front, assuming that major emitters (especially India and China) meet the deadline for reporting their targets under the Accord, the Obama Administration will surely use this progress to pressure the Senate into passing an energy bill.

Although Obama didn't utter the words "cap and trade" during his state of the union speech last night, he did hit the "clean energy/jobs" angle pretty heavy.  Large emitter endorsement of the Accord will likely help the Administration in moving climate and energy legislation.]]></content:encoded>

[caption id="attachment_560" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="Image taken from themobilegarden.org"]<a href="http://themobilegarden.org/index.php"><img class="size-medium wp-image-560" title="mobile garden" src="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/mobile-garden-300x225.jpg" alt="Image taken from themobilegarden.org" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

The idea is to configure a Chicago Transit Authority rail car into a mobile garden, which would visualize the possibilities for enhancing green space in the city.  Additionally, Baldwin promises to plant native plants in the mobile garden, educating Chicagoans about varieties that have historically flourished in the region.

Baldwin's project seems to be a kindred spirit to <a href="http://www.parkingday.org/">Park(ing) Day</a> where citizens commandeer metered parking spaces, lay down sod, bring out lawn chairs, and literally remake the parking space into a park.

These are great examples of creative efforts to get city dwellers to reflect on the human-environment connection and explore the possibilities of using a city's infrastructure to get us to think critically about nature and the urban landscape.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The New York Times has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/us/23train.html?ref=us">an interesting article</a> on the planned high-speed rail project in central Florida.  Earlier this year Florida was given one of the largest chunks of the <a href="http://dc.streetsblog.org/2010/01/29/biden-says/">$8 billion stimulus money</a> to improve passenger rail travel in the US.

Today's article points out that the route that will benefit from the money--Orlando to Tampa--has some shortcomings.  One issue is that the route will only cover a distance of 84 miles.  The concern is that the route is too short to take mode share away from planes and rail.  It is not a hard and fast science, but generally distances in excess of 200 miles make high-speed rail attractive to travelers.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid%E2%80%93Sevilla_high-speed_rail_line">line between Madrid and Sevilla</a> in Spain (293 miles) <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:HvVp4AANGK0J:fondazionesvilupposostenibile.org/f/News/Brochure%2BModal%2BShift%2BTechno.pdf+high+speed+rail+mode+share+cars&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShmwYg2Gza6XnNy1u_fZtRM4l2ml9OnD0g7Ep4c0UKi3I-RLIM4obhVHMReAoxsUe65uG1rNl4qpXQbBSSUGFeWLN3U_kSHUaMsbZKD9Y3KSZe7KcciEtdy4X73LQwpb7I-csIH&amp;sig=AHIEtbTvgnbH1B9kug8EdUUUhxNTbhdvAw">contributed</a> to a 50% reduction in auto share and around a 6% reduction in air travel between the two cities.

The other problem is the route itself.  The Orlando terminus is the airport--an isolated complex on the southern edge of the city--and the Tampa terminus is downtown.  The route will include a stop at the Walt Disney World resort, but will bypass the Tampa airport.

Both Tampa and Orlando have inadequate local public transport systems, which means riders arriving in each city will be faced with significant mobility challenges when they disembark the train.  In Orlando the downtown financial and government districts are more than an hour away from the airport station by local (and infrequent) buses.

What this shows is that walkability and land use issues need to be given greater consideration in transportation planning.  You will be able to get from Orlando to Tampa quickly, but once you get to your destination you will likely be faced with another mobility challenge.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks, Bruce & Nathaneael for the comments.

When I lived in Orlando about a decade ago the various municipalities could never agree on an alignment for a northern light rail corridor, losing out on a bunch of John Mica-endorsed federal financing.

Before I left in '03, Mica was pushing a much less ambitious commuter rail plan going from downtown Orlando to Sanford (I think).  The southern Orange County tourist corridor was generally hostile to any rail development.

I haven't been following debates down there, so I don't know too much about the actual proposed line, but I find it interesting (and not surprising) that Disney donated land for a stop that will whisk tourists from the airport to the Kingdom--bypassing all of the other tourist attractions in the area.]]></wp:comment_content>

US Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar was in Massachusetts today <a href="http://views.washingtonpost.com/climate-change/post-carbon/2010/04/salazar_to_approve_cape_wind.html">to announce</a> that the Department of Interior is approving the Cape Cod offshore wind farm.

The project has been incredibly contentious in Massachusetts, resulting in a nine-year delay on moving forward and the development of unusual political fissures in the state.   The project was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/04/20/cape.cod.wind.farm/">famously opposed by the late Ted Kennedy</a> who was thought to have been worried about its impact on the Nantucket Sound--a prime yachting corridor.   Other Massachusetts politicians, including Governor Deval Patrick, have been key supporters, recognizing the economic development potential and the environmental benefits from an expansion of wind energy.

Salazar did make some concessions to opponents.   The project will be smaller than initially anticipated with 130 turbines, rather than 170, approved.  Salazar also indicated that the developer will have to do more marine archaeological surveys and reduce the visual impact of the turbines.

Given how prevalent the off-shore wind development is in Europe, it is amazing that the Cape Wind project will be the first of its kind in the US.  Much of the delay has been due to the lack of federal leadership on the issue.  Thankfully, Salazar recognized this problem and said that nine years of review for a project is excessive and that the process should be more "rational and orderly."

He also indicated that today's approval of Cape Wind should be seen as a signal that the approval process should not be so onerous for other projects in development on the Atlantic coast.

There are still hurdles to overcome before Cape Wind is a reality.  Although Gov. Patrick said that construction will begin next year, the deregulated electricity market has to be taken into account.   Cape Wind will need to sell its electricity to distributors.  If the price point is insufficient, this could have an impact on the financing needed to carry out a massive construction project.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Prospects for a Global Climate Deal in 2010 Not Looking Good </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="240" caption="Photo of Jairam Ramesh by Matthew McDermott"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/matmcdermott/"><img title="Jairam Ramesh" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2542/3945921526_84c5e8181f_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160" /></a>[/caption]

The Chinese government hosted the "International Cooperative Conference on Green Economy and Climate Change" this weekend in Beijing.  It brought together environment ministers and climate negotiators to discuss the way forward in global climate policy.

The press accounts suggest very little movement towards a comprehensive climate agreement.  The lead Chinese negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90883/6977772.html">reiterated the concept</a> of "common but differentiated responsibilities."   This, of course, is the idea that the developed countries which benefited from decades of carbon-intensive growth should take the lead in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.

Much of the press from the conference centers around comments made by the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh who admitted that discussions have <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/Climate-talks-at-dead-end-says-India/Article1-541520.aspx">essentially reached a "dead end"</a> since the US and China won't agree to binding emissions cuts.  He was joined in his skepticism by Danish environment minister <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100509/sc_afp/chinaindiaclimatewarming_20100509114732">Connie Hedegaard who said an agreement</a> at COP16 in Mexico was not probable.

Most interesting to those following the climate negotiations were descriptions of back-door negotiations at least year's Copenhagen conference provided by Ramesh.  Last week, Der Spiegel released <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,692861,00.html">a leaked audio recording</a> of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/22/copenhagen-climate-change-mark-lynas">a meeting</a> on 18 December involving Barack Obama, Angela Merkel, Nicholas Sarkozy, Manmohan Singh, Gordon Brown, and the Chinese deputy foreign minister, He Yafei.  The audio depicts frustration from the European leaders about the lack of progress in the negotiations and culminated in Obama indicating that talks outside the UN process could be more fruitful.

The Spiegel audio ends with the Chinese asking for the meeting to be suspended.  At that point the leaders of China, India, South Africa, and Brzail convened in a different room to strategize.  Although not invited, Obama crashed the meeting to demand a deal get hashed out.  The resultant document was the <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:lp_RKkIW-EEJ:unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/cop15/eng/l07.pdf+copenhagen+accord&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiZNwiuqKEdTaTUUCBGEqIt-aZg3hOhj95ofd7k8bcGc1kiLthXWFqJ3kB5R90Ra53X-eIVs4nhXkqOWFzFIMELu4Slo9NBQtYYMq9lXE7zIaPcvJf-fxqfh2DuokJ03eVmHZ2K&amp;sig=AHIEtbTCwwmn3FbhKPmHN_1XHsgGKwTYFA">Copenhagen Accord</a>.

Ramesh <a href="http://www.wtop.com/?nid=220&amp;sid=1953064">recounts</a> that Xie Zhenhua was banging his hand on the table and talking angrily in Chinese.  US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apparently asked what he was saying and Obama deadpanned: "he's congratulating us."

If Ramesh's account is correct, it shows that there is a great deal of distance between the US and China and there is little to suggest that the fundamental disagreements have been dealt with in five months since Copenhagen.

Official negotiations start up again in June.  It is likely that we will see a continued stalemate.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Logistics for Cancun Climate Negotiations: Another Copenhagen? </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="240" caption="Moon Palace Resort, Cancun, photo: Thomas J. Hartnett"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/agoraphobic/"><img title="Moon Palace Resort, Cancun" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3487/3866824740_87cdc21b65_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" /></a>[/caption]

Last year's climate negotiations in Copenhagen left much to be desired.  Instead of  a comprehensive global deal with a legally-binding treaty, we saw a voluntary political agreement with weak mitigation targets.   For those who attended the negotiations, simply participating as an observer, delegate, or journalist was equally frustrating.   The venue--Copenhagen's Bella Center--did not have the capacity to accommodate the 40,000+ attendees; and the management of the crowds was not done with much efficiency.  Many observers and media had to wait hours in the frigid Danish cold for their accreditation and subsequent access to the venue.

For the last four days of the two-week negotiations, civil society was essentially blocked from the venue, making it difficult for indigenous groups, environmental NGOs, and others to monitor and influence the talks.

As a response, civil society groups waged protests which were quelled by <a href="http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/dec2009/2009-12-16-01.asp">heavy-handed Danish police</a>.  Both the Danish government and the UNFCCC endured criticism for the chaos that ensued and <a href="http://itsgettinghotinhere.org/2010/04/11/copenhagens-legacy-or-dealing-with-logistics-restrictions-on-civil-society-participation/">pledged to make participation smoother</a> at the next big round of negotiations taking place in Cancun this December.

The  Mexican government recently <a href="http://www.cop16.mx/es/index.htm">launched the website</a> for the conference and it is beginning to provide a glimpse of how the negotiations will be managed.

It looks as if <a href="http://www.cop16.mx/en/sede.htm">there will be two venues</a>: the exclusive <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com/resorts/moonpalace/">Moon Palace Resort</a> will hold the actual negotiations while a brand new conference center, “Cancún Messe,” will accommodate the side events and exhibitions .  The implication of this arrangement is that access to the major negotiators and decision makers can easily be restricted.  Unlike the Bella Center, which was relatively accessible via rail, Moon Palace is <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=Km+340+Carretera+Cancun+-+Chetumal+Cancun,+QU+77500&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Km+340+Carretera+Cancun+-+Chetumal+Cancun,+QU+77500&amp;hnear=Evanston,+IL&amp;radius=15000&amp;ll=20.988849,-86.85894&amp;spn=0,0.110378&amp;z=13&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=20.988631,-86.858918&amp;panoid=hKHdmOwadVkMf5awpi2Dug&amp;cbp=12,60.81,,0,14.44">isolated</a> and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Federal+Highway+307,+Cancun+mx&amp;sll=21.207459,-87.107849&amp;sspn=0.926919,1.766052&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Federal+Highway+307,&amp;hnear=Canc%C3%BAn,+Qr,+Mexico&amp;ll=20.984281,-86.842117&amp;spn=0.02901,0.055189&amp;t=h&amp;z=14">situated behind a bunker of golf courses</a>, making it even easier to seal off.

This is clearly going to frustrate many civil society groups.  One of the amazing things about these UN meetings is the relative accessibility civil society has to negotiators.  Many of the country delegations meet with NGOs throughout the negotiations to hear their concerns and to provide updates about how discussions are proceeding.  In Copenhagen, once inside the Bella Center, you could basically roam freely throughout the complex as an observer, sitting in on open negotiations, visiting  countries' temporary offices, meeting negotiators in the hallway, etc...In fact t<a href="http://adoptanegotiator.org/">here is even one NGO that shadows negotiators</a> to inject the process with a degree of transparency.

With two separated sites these types of interactions will be difficult to pull off.  The unfortunate result will be a lessening of transparency and public understanding of a complex and crucial political process.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="400" caption="Maritim Hotel, Bonn, site of the UN Climate Talks"]<img title="Maritim Hotel" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_xt5syhDhvXI/TANv7ZGnfAI/AAAAAAAADxw/fcooJuNpPCM/s400/IMAG0174.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="238" />[/caption]

Today marks the beginning of the first major international climate talks since last December's meeting in Copenhagen.  That meeting, of course, ended in a storm of controversy and uncertainty with the United States hailing its non-binding political declaration as a "breakthrough" and much of the rest of the world expressing disappointment that there was not a legally binding agreement to deal with the climate crisis.

The United States has always maintained that the Copenhagen Accord is a first step on the way (perhaps) to a legal agreement, but as the weeks proceed to the next major meeting scheduled for December in Cancun, there seems to be little movement.

In Bonn, the parties will be taking up <a href="http://unfccc.int/documentation/documents/advanced_search/items/3594.php?rec=j&amp;priref=600005797#beg">an actual negotiating text</a> that is supposed to serve as the basis for an agreement.   However, the text does not come very close to resolving the key issues around the acceptable global temperature rise, greenhouse gas emissions reduction levels, which parties should reduce emissions, and the time line for reductions.

Additionally, the negotiations are still proceeding on two separate tracks--one involving the parties to the Kyoto Protocol (which excludes the US) that is trying to figure out how that agreement will function after the first phase of its implementation finishes in 2012 and another on "long term cooperative action" which includes the major emitters.

Fundamentally, the negotiations are at much the same stage as they were <a href="http://hughbartling.com/?p=340">last year at this point</a>.  Given the fact that all of the major issues are still outstanding, it is unclear what sort of progress will be made in the next two weeks in Bonn.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Boat Public Transit Scheme for Chicago?</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=583</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[An <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/nyregion/06critic.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Boat%20transit%20new%20york&amp;st=cse">article in last Friday's New York Times</a> asks the question: why doesn't New York City have more ferries?  The Staten Island Ferry is probably the most well known; and, of course, there is the popular <a href="http://www.nywatertaxi.com/commuters/ikea/">water taxi</a> from Wall Street to the Ikea in Red Hook, Brooklyn.  But in a high-density urban area surrounded by water, the author argues that the water transportation potential is underutilized.

The New York City Economic Development Corporation is currently putting together a "<a href="http://www.nycedc.com/NEWSPUBLICATIONS/STUDIES/COMPREHENSIVECITYWIDEFERRYSTUDY/Pages/ComprehensiveCitywideFerryStudy.aspx">Comprehensive Citywide Ferry Study</a>," which should provide some guidance on expanding water transportation in the city.

I've always thought that here in Chicago water transportation options could be a fruitful area for reducing congestion and for expanding mobility options.  In particular, the Chicago River and its tributaries could be used in this regard.  Currently there are a couple of water taxi services that connect the main commuter rail stations on the west Loop with Michigan Avenue and Chinatown.  But aside from the water taxis, passenger travel on the river is limited to private boats and tours.

I am sure there are engineering, navigational, and <a href="http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2010/06/water-officials-a-cleaner-river-would-be-more-dangerous.html?obref=obinsite">health and safety</a> issues that would need to be squared away before expanding passenger travel on the river, but below I've put together a "back of the napkin" map of an ideal route.

Docks are situated at 1.5-2 mile intervals.  In some areas the docks would serve neighborhoods with limited access to the rapid transit system while in others docks would be integrated with rail and bus to enhance mulitmodality.

I'm not sure about the timing or what sort of craft would be viable, but theoretically you could travel from the northern suburb of Evanston to downtown Chicago in a little more than an hour--making it competitive with local trains.  The greatest potential would be for the north side Chicago neighborhoods where boat transit could be integrated with neighborhood commercial districts in areas like Logan Square/Lincoln Square, North/Clybourn, or Lincoln/Peterson.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I totally agree we should better utilize the river for transit. Even if it's not a great solution for getting people from the far north side to downtown, it would better connect communities along the river and could help solidify the river as an economic corridor. There are also several points where there could be transfers between the river transit and the CTA and Metra. So the river could act as a feeder service to better connect people to faster trains to downtown.

I'd also love to see Chicago establish a ferry service to connect us to western Michigan communities. There are some great towns over there on Lake Michigan I'd love to visit, but they're not easy to get to by train/bus. Summer ferry service to downtown Saugatuck would be very nice.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'd like to see Riverine Transit in Chicago as much as the next person, but because of the long distances it's really not feasible.  If the Chicago Water Taxi is indicative, you can't expect boats to average more than about 5-7 mph--even though your plan would have longer distances between stops, the snaking nature of the river on the north side prevents excessive speed.

Your plan assumes 9 mph travel, and even that yields 90 minute travel times from downtown Evanston (Church St.) to Wolf Point.  Perhaps people will accept the slower mode of travel as the land along the North Branch made more friendly to the river, (as opposed to the big box stores that currently back up to it) but certainly not yet.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment, Ted.  Yeah, this is more of a thought experiment than a serious proposal.  

The time/distances to Evanston are probably not feasible.  But I would have maybe a little more hope for, perhaps, going as far north as Lawrence?!?  

Integrating river transport with the transformation of riparian areas into recreation corridors would be essential.

I guess the nice thing about boats is that there is no impact on existing surface routes and the capital investment would likely be lower than bus rapid transit, trains, etc...]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>What Happens to Kyoto After 2012?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The UN climate change secretariat <a href="http://unfccc.int/documentation/documents/advanced_search/items/3594.php?rec=j&amp;priref=600005922&amp;suchen=n">released an interesting legal note</a> today laying out what will happen to the  major legally-binding, global treaty in place to address the problem of global warming pollution beginning in 2013.

Under the Kyoto Protocol, countries have agreed to a "first commitment period" whereby most of the developed economies pledge to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 2012.   After 2012, these countries are no longer bound by their commitments and, theoretically, can start emitting greenhouse gases  without regard to their global impact.

There were significant problems with Kyoto; namely, the emissions reductions targets are not adequate enough to stave off dramatic climatic change over the course of the next several decades and major emitters--like the United States, China, and India--are not currently covered by its provisions.

For the past several years, there have been two negotiating tracks going on to deal with Kyoto' shortcomings.  On the one hand, those countries who have ratified Kyoto have been negotiating to improve the treaty.  But this track--the <a href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/4577.php">Ad-Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties Under the Kyoto Protocol</a>--excludes the United States and (currently) doesn't ask big emitters like India and China to engage in legally-binding reductions.

The other negotiating track--the <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/ad_hoc_working_groups/lca/items/4381.php">Ad-Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action Under the Convention</a>--does include the United States, China, India, and other major emitters.   The second track was established in 2007 with the thought that some type of successor agreement to Kyoto would be negotiated and that there would be a seamless transition from the Kyoto Protocol to a new legally-binding agreement.

The second track hasn't produced much progress, so there is quite a bit of confusion as to what will happen after 2012.  Today's note doesn't lay out a very promising scenario.

Here are the highlights:
<ul>
	<li>If a second commitment period (with new emissions reductions numbers) is going to begin on 1 January 2013, a final text laying out those obligations really has to be completed by the December meeting in Cancun.</li>
	<li>Even if a text is agreed upon in December, it still needs to be informally accepted by three-fourths of the 143 countries which are party to the Protocol by 3 October 2012 and then ratified by domestic legislatures by the end of 2012.  This is an EXTREMELY accelerated timetable.</li>
	<li>Parties could amend the Kyoto Protocol to make it easier for a second commitment period to go into force.  They could create an "opt-out" clause where it is assumed the country will accept the commitment period unless they notify the UN.  This might make it more politically viable for countries to sign on, but there still needs to be domestic buy-in before the treaty is legally-binding.</li>
	<li>There could be a "provisional" amendment to the protocol with new commitments, but until it is legally ratified, it is essentially voluntary.</li>
	<li>They could extend the first commitment period for a number of years.  One problem with this is that many countries have expressed a political (not legal) commitment to limit global warming to a 2 degree rise from pre-industrial levels by 2050.  Extending the first commitment emissions numbers won't reach this goal.  It would also require an amendment to the treaty, which still poses problems with getting the requisite number of countries to ratify before 2013.</li>
</ul>
None of these options look particularly promising.  So what will happen in 2013?
<ul>
	<li>Emissions reductions targets will no longer be required.</li>
	<li>Countries will not have to submit reports to the UNFCCC on their emissions.</li>
	<li>Countries will not have to maintain a registry for emissions offsets--a key point for developing countries which can use financing under the treaty for low-carbon developing projects.</li>
	<li>Emissions trading markets could be disrupted</li>
</ul>
Essentially, you would have an entire architecture of emissions management--flawed as it is--fall apart.

This legal note was written to give negotiators guidance going into next month's intersessional negotiations in Bonn.  My sense is that it is a pretty dire document--we'll see if negotiators think so as well in a couple of weeks.]]></content:encoded>

Bike-sharing is one of the smartest trends sweeping urban transportation planning these days.  The idea is that you set up kiosks around a city where a number of bikes are parked securely.  Riders use a credit card or subscription card to "check out" a bike.   They then ride it to another kiosk and drop it off.

It works great for trips less than a mile.  It is convenient (no waiting for a bus or train) and carbon neutral.

The concept has been around for several decades, but it really took off in 2007 when Paris initiated its <a href="http://www.velib.paris.fr/">Vélib’</a> system which features 20,000 bicycles and over 1500 kiosks.  Since then cities as disparate as Mexico City, Montreal, and Washington, DC have established programs (for more info on the global bike share movement, I highly recommend the <a href="http://bike-sharing.blogspot.com/">Bike-Sharing Blog</a>).

Beginning Friday, <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7578373">Chicago will be the latest entry</a> into the bike sharing game.  The system has been a long-time coming.   Chicago's Mayor Richard M. Daley is well known as being a biking enthusiast and advocate of "green" public policy.  After a visit to Paris and <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14429468">testing out their system</a> in 2007, he expressed interest in bringing the concept to Chicago.

Unfortunately <a href="http://www.chicagobcycle.com/">the system that will be inaugurated this week</a> is too modest and too geared to tourists to have any significant impact on mobility for the vast majority of Chicagoans.

Last year, I had a group of students look into what makes a bike sharing program successful as part of an effort to give the Chicago suburb of Evanston information on the subject.  Evanston was involved in transportation master-planning and its <a href="http://www.cityofevanston.org/government/departments/public-works/transportation-engineering/multi-modal-transportation-plan/index.php">consultants had recommended</a> bike sharing as a program to possibly reduce congestion.

<a href="http://goo.gl/g4WT">According to our preliminary research</a>, there are a few essential elements that a bike sharing scheme must have in order to make an impact on mobility choices in a city.
<ul>
	<li>It should be convenient.  Kiosks need to be placed near activity centers and bikes should be plentiful.  No one will use the service if it doesn't allow them to go where they need to be and the reliable supply of bikes is essential to get people in the habit of using the service.  The activity centers need to be varied--cultural spots, residences, workplaces, shopping districts.  This allows many potential destinations as well as helps bikes circulate through the system so you don't have all the bikes at one station during particular times of the day.</li>
	<li>It should be cheap.  Bikes are one of the cheapest and most efficient forms of transportation; however, there are still costs involved (maintenance, purchase of bikes &amp; kiosks, IT infrastructure to keep track of bikes, etc...).  The trick is to figure out a way to keep the price point at a level where it costs less for the average consumer than other forms of transportation (driving, cabs, etc...).  In order to meet these costs, many cities privatize the system.  The operators will put advertising on the bikes or--as in the case with Paris--the bike service will be part of the general outdoor advertising franchise that cities sell to billboard companies.</li>
	<li>It should be integrated with other modes of transport.  Kiosks should be set up next to train &amp; bus stations, car sharing spots, parking lots.  This allows for flexibility in movement for the user and translates into more successful system.  The picture above, for instance, was taken in Frankfurt at a place called Schweizer Platz.  The bike sharing kiosk is located at the top of the steps of a U-Bahn station and at the corner of a tram line.  At this spot you can transfer from bike-to-tram, bike-to-U-Bahn, etc...</li>
</ul>
So how does Chicago measure up on this metric?  The main problem--at this point--is that the system is extremely small and is not integrated with a wide variety of activity centers.  There are only 6 full-service kiosks where you can drop off and pick up a bike.  Three of them are (more or less) strictly tourist destinations (Buckingham Fountain, the Field Museum, McCormick Place).  For those readers unfamiliar with Chicago, basically these spots are destinations with a single use.  The number of residencies and work places near these kiosks is small.   You are not likely to see the bike share displace many higher-carbon trips since the kiosks are essentially inconvenient.

The cost is another factor.  A temporary pass costs $10 for the first hour and $5 for each subsequent 30 minutes.  You can also get a monthly membership that costs $35 which gives you the first hour free and charges $2.50 for each subsequent 30 minutes.

This is way too expensive and is further evidence that the scheme is designed primarily for tourists who may be willing to pay more for a pleasant bike ride on the city's lakefront.  Most schemes that are designed to be integral parts of a city's transport system have a very small up-front cost.  London's new bike share program (which also starts on Friday) is <a href="http://planetgreen.discovery.com/tech-transport/bike-sharing-is-coming-to-london-soon.html">not only much bigger</a>, but only <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/cycling/14811.aspx">charges 1 pound for a single day pass</a> with free usage for the first half hour.

As a point of comparison, in Chicago, lets say I work at the Daley Center and want to eat lunch at the Field Museum (no one would ever want to do this by the way, but that's where the kiosks are).  I would check out a bike for $10, ride the mile or so to the museum in about 15 minutes.  I would check the bike in at the Museum.  After my hour lunch, I would have to check out a new bike for another $10 at the Museum for the return trip to Daley Plaza.  Twenty bucks to go out to the museum for lunch!    Of course, if I had a monthly pass, the $35 that I pay each month would cover both rides.  But because there are only 6 kiosks, I would not be likely to buy a monthly pass.

In London, lets say I get off a train at St. Pancras.  I pay £1 access fee and check out a bike, ride it the 1.5 miles to the British Museum in about 15 minutes.  I hang out in the museum for an hour, check out another bike and take another 15 minute ride to Hyde Park.  Later on, I can check out another bike and ride up to Kensington, etc... For that initial £1, riders get unlimited short rides.

Finally, Chicago's scheme comes up short as a practical transport alternative because of the lack of integration with the city's public transit system.   There are a couple of kiosks that are within a block or two from the city's subway system, but the major Metra commuter rail stations are about a mile away from the nearest kiosk!   The system will be useless for the thousands of commuters who travel into the city center from the city's western and northern suburbs.

I understand that this is essentially a demonstration project.  However, because it doesn't even make an attempt to link with the destinations that everyday residents use, it is hard to get too excited about it.  A better model for the city to follow would have been Washington DC, where a small program began in 2008 that linked a couple of select neighborhoods with the city center.  The program was so successful that the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/21/AR2010052102745.html">District of Columbia is expanding the system</a> to include all of the wards in the city as well as neighboring Arlington, Virginia, creating the first regional scheme in the United States.

Chicago could also learn from Mexico City, which recently started a <a href="http://www.mexicocityexperience.com/voices_from_the_city/detail/mexico_city_bike_town">small neighborhood system in Condesa</a>.  The first stage of the scheme in Condesa began with 85 stations with plans for expansion.

At this stage, it is a bit premature to call Chicago's experiment a proper bike-sharing scheme in the sense that it will enhance mobility options for the city's residents.  Rather, it is a nice tourist amenity to help our visitors enjoy the lakefront and our cultural assets.

<strong>Update [28 Jul. 2010 1:23pm]</strong>

After my initial post, I came across <a href="http://www.activetrans.org/modeshift/03_06/bikeshare">this article</a> by the Active Transportation Alliance explaining the origins of the scheme.  It is not a municipal project.  Rather it is an outgrowth of <a href="http://www.bikechicago.com/">Bike Chicago</a>--a private firm that rents bikes at various locales along the lakefront.  [They also run the dreaded Segway tours that clog downtown sidewalks &amp; bikepaths--please, no Segway sharing schemes!]

I assumed the city was involved given the fact that <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/dps/PreBids/2007PreBids/52863PreBid.pdf">they issued an RFP</a> for a bike share program in 2007 and Mayor Daley apparently <a href="http://twitter.com/igocarsharing/status/19687136818">presided over the ribbon cutting ceremony </a>yesterday for the project.

In reality this scheme is an expansion of the existing bike rental infrastructure targeting tourists and leisure users.  It is premature to call it a proper "bike sharing" program.]]></content:encoded>

The other weird thing that I didn't mention is that they have several drop-off only kiosks, including Millennium Park (which actually would be a natural pick-up spot given the train station) and Navy Pier.  

I have never heard of drop-off only sites!  How do you get back to where you came from?  Take a cab?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>US Climate Envoy: Targets Still Good Without Congress</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Global climate negotiators <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/items/2654.php">hunkered down in Bonn's Hotel Maritim today</a> in one of the last negotiating sessions before the major meeting this December in Cancun.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="240" caption="US Climate Envoy, Todd Stern (photo: Center for American Progress)"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/americanprogress/"><img title="Todd Stern" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/4362917364_a3bd484632_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160" /></a>[/caption]

Last year's negotiations in Copenhagen ended with a political agreement brokered by the United States that said the world should limit warming to 2 degrees centigrade from pre-industrial levels.  All governments that agreed with the sentiment were invited to submit their own domestic commitments by the end of last January.  Those numbers would then be used as the basis for negotiating a more permanent agreement.

Leaving aside the fact <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/02/copenhagen_progress.html">that when you do the math</a>, the global commitments come up short in providing a strong chance at the 2 degree stabilization, with the Senate's recent decision to stop work on climate legislation the US is in a difficult position to defend its own actions at Bonn and help move along the negotiation process.

Today, the <a href="http://unfccc2.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/100802_AWG/templ/ovw_onDemand.php?id_kongressmain=122#">European Union envoy said</a> that they are unlikely to sign on to a continuation of the reductions mandated under the Kyoto agreement without the United States involved in some sort of framework.

Head US negotiator, Todd Stern, <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N0297673.htm">today said</a> that the international community shouldn't worry:  the US commitment stands.  The assumption of the Obama Administration is that they can accomplish significant reductions using regulatory mechanisms via the EPA and other  federal agencies.

This may be the case, <a href="http://www.wri.org/publication/reducing-ghg-emissions-using-existing-federal-authorities-and-state-action">but independent analysis indicates</a> that even if the federal government and all of the states who have plans on the books for greenhouse gas reductions pursue the most aggressive actions, the US 2020 commitment will be unattainable in the absence of Congressional action.

It will be interesting to see global reaction to the US over the next week as the meetings progress in Bonn.  With Stern not backing down from an untenable position, it will give other countries an excuse to avoid their own action creating further stalemate in the effort to come to a global deal.]]></content:encoded>

International negotiators and civil society will be descending on the Mexican resort town of Cancún later this month for the first major UN climate change conference since last year's much-hyped get-together in Copenhagen.

The Copenhagen conference failed to produce a significant international agreement causing many to downplay expectations for the COP16 conference in Cancún.

Yesterday, the head UN climate chief, <a href="http://unfccc2.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/101115_Pressconference/templ/play.php?id_kongresssession=3180">Christiana Figueres gave a press briefing</a> previewing her expectations for the conference.

She declared that there is "optimism for the planet" and "optimism at the multilateral level" for the UNFCCC process.

One interesting point she made to justify her optimism was that many countries have adopted more ambitious domestic climate plans than their international positions reflect.  When pressed for examples she cited China--which is continually criticized by the United States for not agreeing to a sufficiently transparent method for verifying emissions.

As far as actual accomplishments she expects to see in Cancún, she mentioned that there should be a resolution on what should be done with the Kyoto Protocol.  This seems pretty ambitious.  One of the main problems of the negotiations has been the two-track approach endorsed in Bali three years ago.  The first commitment period under Kyoto is set to expire in 2012 and by all accounts it has been ineffective in dealing with the global climate problem.  Much of this has to do with the fact that developing countries are exempt from mandated emissions cuts and the United States does not accept the protocol.

The US would certainly like to see the Kyoto negotiating track get scrapped, but <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/wjb/zwjg/zwbd/t768292.htm">China</a> and <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/India-pitches-for-extension-of-Kyoto-Protocol/articleshow/6903826.cms">India</a> are steadfast in their insistence that Kyoto be the mechanism to reflect the "common but differentiated responsibilities" of different countries.

This will be a key point to watch during the negotiations.  It is likely that the US and the EU are working to get other major developing countries like Mexico, for example, to show more flexibility on the future of Kyoto.  How things proceed in the Kyoto negotiation stream (AWG-KP) will be a key element to follow as the negotiations transpire.

<a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2010/11/150939.htm">Beginning tomorrow</a> in suburban Washington, the main US negotiator, Todd Stern, will be convening a meeting of the major economies.  This group includes India, China, the European Union and other key players.  Although the future of Kyoto will not likely be resolved, the delegates will be discussing ways to deal with international monitoring of emissions by <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/India-proposes-new-emission-check-system/articleshow/6898182.cms">taking up</a> a proposal from India.]]></content:encoded>

The United Nations Environment Programme <a href="http://www.unep.org/publications/ebooks/emissionsgapreport/">released a report</a> last week on the eve of the UN climate change negotiations in Cancún taking stock of last year's <a href="http://unfccc.int/home/items/5262.php">Copenhagen Accord</a>.

The Accord was the document that came out of last year's negotiations.  It is a document that aspires to restrict global warming to 2˚ centigrade but is not legally-binding.  Consequently it relies on voluntary pledges from nations to reduce their emissions.

This report essentially runs the numbers submitted by various countries and compares them to climate modeling scenarios that would "likely" result in the 2 degree stabilization.  Because there is no consistency in <a href="http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/policy/copenhagen-accord-commitments">the commitments submitted by 138 countries</a> in response to the Accord, the report develops four basic implementation scenarios.

The main takeaway is that no matter how you cut it, the Copenhagen Accord commitments are likely insufficient to keep global emissions at a level that limits global warming to 2 degrees.

The report does indicate that the gap can be lessened by having strict accounting for land use offsets and for limiting the number of Kyoto-era reduction credits applicable to Copenhagen Accord commitments.

One of the main problems with the Accord is the lack of specificity in how it "counts" emissions reductions and offsets.  Although the meeting in Cancún is not expected to result in a legally binding treaty, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AH3LT20101118">there could be movement</a> towards developing a shared understanding of some of these ambiguities.  Whether negotiators choose strict accounting methods or allow a multiplicity of loopholes could give some indication about the efficacy of the Accord and the seriousness of the 2 degree warming limit.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Balancing Act in Cancún: Early Impressions of COP-16</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="240" caption="Delegates in COP16 Plenary (photo: UNFCCC)"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/unfccc/"><img title="Delegates" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4125/5222257052_6978edbd31_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160" /></a>[/caption]

The United Nations climate change negotiations are underway in Cancún and the rhetoric from the major developed country parties is that they are searching for "a balanced package of decisions."  The top US negotiator, Todd Stern, used that term <a href="http://www.europolitics.info/sectorial-policies/stern-seeks-balanced-package-of-decisions-at-cancun-art287985-15.html">last week</a> in a pre-conference press conference in Washington and Stern's deputy on the ground in Cancún, Jonathan Pershing, deployed the similar language <a href="http://webcast.cc2010.mx/webmedia_en.html?id=9">in a press conference</a> on Monday.

So what does this mean?  A somewhat <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/nov/30/cancun-climate-change-summit-america">ominous article in the Guardian</a> suggests that the US is adopting an "all or nothing" approach to the talks.   Essentially, the US is pushing large developing country polluters like China and India to submit to emissions cuts from business-as-usual that are internationally monitored and verifiable.  In the absence of this, the US will be less likely to support key developing country concerns, such as financing for climate adaptation and technology assistance.

One reflection of this tension can be seen in the proceedings of the AWG-LCA--the negotiating stream that is looking for an alternative to the Kyoto Protocol.   A <a href="http://unfccc.int/documentation/documents/advanced_search/items/3594.php?rec=j&amp;priref=600005941">negotiating text</a> was prepared in August for this track, but at 70 pages, it is unwieldy and doesn't resolve key issues on safe levels of global warming, who should mitigate emissions and by how much, and how emissions should be monitored and verified.

A<a href="http://unfccc.int/documentation/documents/advanced_search/items/3594.php?rec=j&amp;priref=600006056&amp;data=&amp;title=&amp;author=&amp;keywords=&amp;symbol=&amp;meeting=&amp;mo_from=&amp;year_from=&amp;mo_to=&amp;year_to=&amp;last_days=60&amp;anf=0&amp;sorted=date_sort&amp;dirc=DESC&amp;seite=1#beg"> shorter (33 page) text </a>listing "possible elements of the outcome," was prepared in the interim by the AWG-LCA chair.  It largely papers over the differences in the negotiating text by accepting many of the elements of last year's Copenhagen Accord to the extent that it presents a 2 degree warming threshold and a financing ambition for developing countries of $100 billion (USD) by 2020.

Like the Copenhagen Accord, the "possible outcome" text is sketchy on how to monitor emissions, actual emissions mitigation numbers,  and how the financing mechanism will operate.

What is significant here is that the Copenhagen Accord is essentially being used as a basis for determining what exactly is in the so-called "balanced packages."   Because the US has pushed so hard for some type of international monitoring regime, it will be important to see how these discussions bear out over the next few days.

India <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2010/12/01/01climatewire-india-proposes-a-monitoring-system-for-all-b-16844.html">has emerged</a> as a broker of compromise, setting forth a proposal for international monitoring.  This would meet US concerns, but at this point India is offering its proposal in exchange for keeping the Kyoto Protocol track alive--something that the US (and now <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-30/world-shouldn-t-wait-for-u-s-resolution-on-climate-agreement-japan-says.html">Japan</a>) are not interested in seeing.

China has been the most vocal about resisting US demands for an international monitoring regime, so their response to India's gesture will be another key development to watch for over the coming days.

I'll be blogging "live" from Cancún beginning tomorrow, so stay tuned at this site or over on <a href="http://twitter.com/hughbartling">twitter</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Taking Stock of Week One in Cancún</title>

As is normal with the international climate negotiations, progress has been slow this first week in Cancún. With expections for a substantive agreement at a low point and major issues between developed and large developing countries still evident, it is perhaps to be expected that movement towards agreement would be elusive.

Although the breadth of issues where gaps exist is large, one major fissure that was exposed this week was the future of the Kyoto Protocol.  Japan's announcement early in the week that <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/China-Japan-clash-over-Kyoto-Protocol/articleshow/7040639.cms">it would not agree to a second commitment period</a> for the Protocol is seen as a dramatic abandonment of the only global legal instrument in place to deal with the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.  If Japan isn't committed to the treaty negotiated on its own soil, then why should anyone else?

This position has generated animosity--particularly from China--who insists on second period. 

For the United States--which is not a party to Kyoto--the concern is that the dispute over Kyoto will derail any limited progress that has been made.  US negotiators have been unrelenting in their support for the Copenhagen Accord--the political document that emerged from last year's talks.

Although it is unlikely that the voluntary commitments laid out in the accord will be sufficient enough to meet the accord's target to limit global warming to 2 degrees, senior US negotiators have said that they would rather start with a set of ambitions that are agreed upon in theory and then strengthen them, instead of seeing talks fail.

In the background are <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/03/wikileaks-cables-cancun-climate-van-rompuy">revelations from the WikiLeaks cables </a>documenting developed country duplicity in climate talks over the past two years.  Just as was the case last year, there are <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/environment/UN_Cancun_conference/2010-12/04/content_21479990.htm">rumors of a "secret text"</a> that will kill the Kyoto Protocol.

While that may or may not be the case, there is expected to be released today a more refined document based on the negotiations that have taken place over the past several days.  What is included or excluded from that text will  set the contours for next week's discussions.]]></content:encoded>

Delegates at the UN climate change conference in Cancún held "stock-taking" meetings and a key negotiating document was released over the weekend as high level ministers arrived for the final week of negotiations.

The memory of the last-minute deal in Copenhagen was clearly on the minds of many negotiators as the Mexican Minister overseeing the negotiations took the unusual step of scheduling an <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/statements/application/pdf/espinosa_statement_5dec_for_delivery.pdf">"informal stock-taking meeting"</a> on Sunday, the only scheduled break in negotiations during the two-week period.

The <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/awglca13/eng/crp02.pdf">document released on Saturday</a> did little to resolve major issues related to long-term emissions mitigation and financing, which have plagued the talks for the last year.  One interesting insertion was language pertaining to the Kyoto Protocol.  Developing countries have been adamant about keeping the Kyoto distinction between the two, given the fact that it is a legally-binding instrument that requires emissions cuts by major emitters.

Options in the new document acknowledge the Kyoto framework for countries currently parties to the protocol, but also provides for mitigation actions from the US as well as from the large developing country emitters.

In an ideal world it could continue Kyoto, bring the US to accept Kyoto-like mitigations, and also put developing countries on the record for appropriate mitigation actions.  <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6B55H720101206">Early reports suggest</a> this approach may satisfy China.

It is interesting to see this "Kyoto-+" approach emerge in the texts since a middle path between rejecting Kyoto's second commitment period and starting over has been mentioned for at least the past two years.  It seems to be a testament to the glacial pace of international negotiations.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/unfccc/"><img class="alignright" title="AWG-LCA Chair" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4127/5049968255_206b2c674d_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160" /></a>Early this morning the chair of the key group negotiating a global climate agreement in Cancún <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/awglca13/eng/crp03.pdf">released a vision</a> for "Elements of an Outcome" from the deliberations of the past two weeks.

As might be expected, the document makes minimal progress on some of the key issues keeping countries from coming to an agreement.  On one level, the document could represent a step backward.   The chair's stock-taking document, released on Saturday, included a vision for holding global warming to 2° centigrade.  This ambition is highly contested by many parties.  In today's document the 2° number was 'bracketed" (meaning there is disagreement) and joined by options for 1° and 1.5° warming.

On other key points, it is hard to know whether the new document is an advance, a stagnation, or something else entirely.   For example, the Saturday document called on the world to insure that emissions peaked "as soon as possible," where as today's document has that language bracketed and joined by a specific year for peaking (2015).  The science and economics tell us that an earlier peaking date is more advantageous than one far off in the future, so seeing the 2015 year in the text is positive.  On the other hand, the fact that it was inserted means that some parties are not satisfied with the vagueness of the earlier text suggesting  little movement towards some compromise.

On the mitigation actions to be taken by developed countries, the issues I described in <a href="http://hughbartling.com/?p=626">my previous post</a> have not been resolved.  The document continues to walk the line between the future of the Kyoto Protocol and a new agreement by incorporating language about continuing Kyoto emission obligations in the new document.  But the specifics about what the emissions reductions should be for developed countries are missing.

The same thing applies to the issue of developing country mitigation actions.  The US has been pushing China and India to submit their reductions to international scrutiny--something that those countries do not want to do.  Instead, they assert that they will develop their own domestic procedures.  This is not likely going to satisfy the US.

One advance in the new text are particular timelines for resolving the reporting and verification issue.  For both developing and developed countries, the new text gives parties a year to develop more specific guidelines on how to understand and compare mitigation actions between countries.

On the issue of developing countries receiving finance for the transition to low-carbon sustainable development, there are still significant unresolved issues.  The nature of the fund to be established to finance these activities is not clear.  Options in the text include having the World Bank run the fund, the UNFCCC, or have some new managing authority.

I haven't had the chance to look really closely at the new text in comparison to Saturday's, but the fact that it is actually longer and is ambiguous on so many key points suggests a quagmire at best.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Posturing Accelerates in the Waning Hours of Cancún</title>

The UN climate change talks are in their last 48 hours.  Ministers are here in Cancún as the conference enters its "high level segment."

In an ideal world, the previous week and a half of talks would have produced a document that the ministers could laud whilst waxing admiringly about the ultimate effectiveness of multilateralism.   However, as the past few years of talks attest, the ideal world doesn't exist.

Skepticism emerged last week on the part of many small and poor developing countries who were concerned about secret negotiations and a repeat of Copenhagen where world leaders of a small number of countries flew in and essentially hijacked the talks.

In response, the Mexican president of the conference--Patricia Espinosa--went to great lengths to stress transparency and openness.  However, that appears to  not have been enough to quell concerns about backroom dealing.

Last night, Espinosa <a href="http://www.abc.es/agencias/noticia.asp?noticia=619197">held a meeting with 50 ministers</a> to try and bridge gaps.   The meeting came on the heels of reports that the Indian environment minister, Jairam Ramesh revealed that <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/Ramesh-deviates-from-India-s-stand-at-Cancun/Article1-636196.aspx">India would not be averse</a> to accepting legally-binding emissions cuts.  The day before, China reiterated its position that it rejects this idea.  Some observers see this as a significant breaking of the strong alliance that the two countries forged through their deal-making with the US last year at Copenhagen.  Of course, a major provision of the Copenhagen Accord was that emission mitigation actions should be voluntary.

For the rest of today, ministers and the leaders who came to Cancún will continue to give their statements in the public portion of the meeting.  It is certain that behind the scenes talks are continuing and documents are being developed.

On the penultimate day of negotiations the positions are clear: the US wants to see a "balanced package of decisions" which links financing to the Global South with movement on a verifiable emissions reduction commitment on the part of large developing nations;  large parts of the developing world  want the continuation of the Kyoto system that binds developed countries to a new round of emissions cuts.

Will the gap be bridged by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/09/cancun-climate-summit-alternative-deal">new compromise alliances</a>? Or will the talks essentially end with a resounding thud?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Guns, Garbage and Gas: A Sampling of COP16 Side Events</title>

While most of my posts from Cancún have focused on the progress in the climate negotiations, that is only one element of the UN climate change conference.  Each day there are dozens of side events where researchers and policymakers talk about specific responses to the climate crisis.

This afternoon as the high level ministers delivered <a href="http://unfccc.int/statements/items/5777.php">their statements on the negotiations</a>, I attended three side events.  These give you a flare for what one could expect to encounter in a typical day.

The first one was organized by the European Parliament and focused onj what the EU is doing on the policy front to encourage energy efficiency.  For many of the developed countries, a significant proportion of their emissions are the result of waste.

Recognizing that waste is one of the "low-hanging fruit," that should be easy to eliminate with education and the right incentive structure, they have adopted some pretty simple and inexpensive policies to address this issue.  Ivo Belet talked about the new energy labeling program, where by the end of next year, many products will have to have written on their packaging their greenhouse gas content.  He discussed specifically <a href="http://www.eppgroup.eu/press/showpr.asp?PRControlDocTypeID=1&amp;PRControlID=8529&amp;PRContentID=14792&amp;PRContentLG=en">a new labeling system for automobile tires</a>, saying that tire performance is a strong determinant of fuel efficiency.  Give consumers the information, and they are more likely to make smart purchases.  Conincidentially, a group of Republican-led House members <a href="http://www.mnn.com/transportation/cars/stories/no-letter-grades-on-new-cars-house-lawmakers-say">came out</a> today against better auto fuel labeling in the US.  The EU is implementing a lot of simple and effective policies.  One wonders why policymakers in the US are incapable of learning from their European counterparts.

Later, I went to a side event sponsored by the government of Brazil.  Two researchers from the <a href="http://www.ipea.gov.br/portal/">Institute of Applied Economic Research</a> presented work estimating the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that could be mitigated from stronger recycling programs in the country.  They proposed a shift in the incentive system to give a better price for certain recyclables based on their total ecological worth, rather than their simple market price.

<a href="http://www.connectsolutions.com/cop16/events/12-09_03.html">The last event</a> I went to was sponsored by the United States Departement of State and involved three uniformed representatives from the Department of Defense.   The topic was the national security consequences of climate change--a topic that gets very little treatment in both the political and policy circles.

The Pentagon representatives portrayed themselves as fully engaged with the implications of climate change.  The bulk of the discussion by the presenters, however, was on adaptation.  Given the fact that many military bases--particularly naval--are situated in threatened environments, it makes sense that they would be concerned with the impacts of climate change.  They mentioned that <a href="http://www.grist.org/article/2010-02-01-pentagon-climate-change-energy-security-and-economic-stability-a">climate change is given treatment in the Quadrennial Defense Review</a>--a major departmental strategic document.

I found it interesting to hear these servicemen talk about the climate threat and to reflect on the disfunction in Congress on climate.  Many of the most anti-science members of Congress  like Inhofe or Fred Upton also purport to be "pro-military."  I'm wondering how they resolve these incongruities!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Trying to Salvage a Deal in Cancún: Eleventh Hour Negotiating Text Released</title>

<strong>Updated 7:25pm</strong>

The UN climate change negotiations in Cancún were originally supposed to be over at 6pm CST.  Instead of heading to the beach, bars, or nightclubs, delegates were treated with a new negotiating document at 5pm and the promise of all-night talks in an effort to finish the two-week session with a "positive outcome."

This document is being poured over right now by delegates in advance of another stock-taking meeting at 11pm.  What happens at that point is anyone's guess.

But here are some highlights from my quick, first read of the document:
<ul>
	<li>On the <strong>vision for long-term action</strong>, the document keeps the Copenhagen Accord goal of a 2° limit on global warming but also calls for a review beginning in 2013 and concluding in 2015 to see if the science calls for a safer goal of 1.5°.</li>
	<li>Gas emissions should peak "as soon as possible."  There is no specific date listed, but it calls for working "towards identifying a time frame for global peaking."  Most economists argue the sooner we peak, the cheaper the adaptation costs.</li>
	<li>On <strong>mitigation</strong> <strong>for developed countries</strong>, it asks developed countries to communicate their emissions goals to the Secretariat and leaves to the future the precise mechanisms for identifying how they will do this (e.g. the role of offsets, land use, etc...).</li>
	<li>Significantly, the mitigation section makes no mention of Kyoto and has no specific numeric targets or a deadline for developed country mitigation actions!   The first emission is less problematic because of advances on the Kyoto track of negotiations while the latter makes the document extremely weak.  You really need to have SOME target if you are going to reach the 2 degree goal!</li>
	<li>On <strong>mitigation for developing countries</strong>, the document calls for them to take "appropriate mitigation actions...aimed at achieving a deviation in emissions relative to 'business as usual' emissions in 2020."  Like the developed countries, they will communicate their actions to the secretariat.  The implications of some of the language is hard to decipher, but in this section the document explicitly uses the worlds "voluntarily inform."</li>
	<li>On <strong>monitoring and verification</strong> (a big concern of the US): goes for domestic verification "in accordance to guidelines to be developed under the Convention"--whatever that means.  This is clearly an attempt to bridge the US and China dispute on monitoring and verification.  The latter sees international monitoring and verification as an infringement on its sovereignty.   Will it work?</li>
	<li>On <strong>fast-start finance</strong>: it "notes" the Copenhagen accord commitment of $30 billion through 2012 and "invites" donor countries to submit information about their spending.</li>
	<li>Decides to establish a Green Climate Fund with a board comprising 24 members with equal developing and developed country.  It "invites" the World Bank to be the fund's interim trustee.  representation.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/ad_hoc_working_groups/lca/items/4381.php">AWG-LCA</a> will continue to discuss legal options</li>
</ul>
I am sure there is more that I am missing, but on first glance it looks like this is a document meant to operationalize the Copenhagen Accord.  It keeps the 2 degree ambition, but fails to recognize that there is a gap in the Copenhagen commitments achieving that goal.  It asks all countries to reduce emissions or emissions growth, but has no strong mechanisms to insure countries keep their word.  And it doesn't resolve the controversy over the future of the Kyoto Protocol.

Parties are scheduled to debate this text at around 11pm.  It should be a long night.

<strong>Update: </strong>The absence of the Kyoto language may be less of an issue, since <a href="http://twitter.com/rjtklein/status/13402853250957312">Richard Klein tells me</a> there has been an agreement on the other negotiating track to have a second commitment period for the protocol.  Everything is still tentative since both of these texts will still be debated later this evening.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>CTA Contemplates Dramatic Changes for North Side Train Lines</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=646</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Chicago Transit Authority announced details last week regarding a <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/rpmproject/">modernization project</a> for two of its major north side elevated train lines.  The lines at issue are the Red and Purple which serve the Loop, Lakeview, Uptown, Rogers Park and the suburban communities of Evanston and Wilmette.

Like most of Chicago's elevated rail system, the Red and Purple lines are in dire need of modernization, upkeep, and expansion.  Determining exactly what should be done in the context of limited funds is going to be a challenge.

This month the CTA is presenting various modernization options for public comment.  Here is a thumbnail sketch of what is contained in the <a href="http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/01/03/2010-33065/intent-to-prepare-an-environmental-impact-statement-for-proposed-transit-improvements-to-the-north#p-28">Notice of Intent document</a> released last week.

Currently the Purple Line runs local from Wilmette through Evanston and then express to Belmont in Lakeview where it follows the Brown line stops to downtown.  The Purple Line only runs on the weekdays during the rush hours.

[caption id="attachment_647" align="alignleft" width="287" caption="Purple and Red Lines Current Configuration"]<a href="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/PurpRed.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-647 " title="CTA Map" src="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/PurpRed-287x300.jpg" alt="" width="287" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

The Red Line is a local train that runs at all hours, seven days a week between Howard St. at the city's northernmost boundary down to 95th Street on the city's south side.

Taken together, the lines generate 128,000 trips on an average weekday and are responsible for about 20% of all CTA rail trips.

In addition to doing nothing, one option being considered is the "Basic Rehabilitation Alternative."  This alternative keeps existing stations and service, but brings the system "into a minimal state of good repair."  This option entails making a handful of stations ADA-compliant and doing minimal upgrades.

The second option is a "Basic Rehabilitation with Transfer Stations." option.  This would follow the above model, but would add Wilson and Loyola as transfer stations for the Purple Line.  This would slow down the Purple line for Evanston commuters, but allow two more stops for riders in Uptown and Rogers Park.

<a href="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/PurRedBasic.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-648" title="PurRedBasic" src="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/PurRedBasic-287x300.jpg" alt="Basic Rehab with Loyola and Wilson Transfer stations" width="287" height="300" /></a>The third option is the "Modernization 4-Track Alternative."  This option decreases the number of stations north of Belmont from 21 to 17.  You would still have the two new transfer stations, but the South Boulevard Purple Line station in Evanston would be eliminated as well as the Lawrence,  Thorndale, and Jarvis stations on the Red Line.

To compensate for the loss of stations, platforms would be extended and new entrances would be built in key stations and there could be "potential expanded hours of express service."

[caption id="attachment_649" align="alignleft" width="287" caption="Modernization 4-Track Alternative"]<a href="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/PurRedFourTrack.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-649" title="PurRedFourTrack" src="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/PurRedFourTrack-287x300.jpg" alt="" width="287" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

The next option is the "Modernization 3-Track Alternative."  This follows the station closures of the previous option, but instead of having the expanded express service you actually have a decrease in express service.  Currently the Purple Line operates both north and south during weekday rush hours between Belmont and Howard on two of the tracks while the Red Line operates local service on the other two tracks.  The rationale for switching to a three-track option is to improve stations and make them ADA compliant.  This requires widening platforms--something that can be done within the existing right-of-way if you remove one of the tracks.  The catch is that the express train will only run inbound in the morning and outbound in the afternoon.

People who commute from the city to Evanston would be negatively impacted by this change.

The final alternative is called the "Modernization 2-Track Alternative."  Under this scenario, the existing above-ground Red Line would be transformed into a subway.   The train would go underground north of Belmont and emerge above ground at Loyola.  The elevated stops between Morse and Belmont would be eliminated and essentially be replaced by seven subway stations on the same streets as the "Modernization" options listed above.

It is unclear what would happen to the elevated section, but this option would eliminate ALL express trains.  Apparently this would be compensated somewhat by better track alignment in the new subway section.

Assessment:  First, these lines are in dire need of upgrades.  The CTA is still running a nineteenth-century transit system.  Dilapidated viaducts result in slow zones and many stations are not ADA-compliant and in dire need of makeovers.  This is largely due to decades of minimal investment.

That said, I'm generally unenthusiastic about removing transit stops.  In each of the areas where there are proposed stop eliminations many small businesses are located.  And the more stops you have, there is a higher propensity for people to use transit instead of driving.

It is true that the more stops you have on a train line can result in longer trips since the train stops more frequently.

One curious omission from the proposals is to revert back to the old Red Line configuration which used an <a href="http://chicago-l.org/operations/lines/route_ops/A-B.html">A/B "skip stop" system</a>.  This speeds up the Red Line by reducing the number of trains that stop at smaller stations.

Given the shaky economic environment, some of the options presented--like the subway --seem overly ambitious.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I can't speak to the others, but the Lawrence stop is a good candidate for elimination. Lawrence is absurdly close to Wilson, and it doesn't even have a station house anyway. Removing it would still leave an appropriate distance between Wilson and Argyle that is more consistent with the rest of the system's spacing and with urban rail generally. If Wilson were rehabbed to include a Purple stop, I think most people in the area would prefer that to retaining a Lawrence station on the Red Line.]]></wp:comment_content>

I disagree. The Orange Line is not in need of modernization or upkeep. Same with the Pink and Brown lines. Also, the Red line south of Chinatown was already rehabilitated in the past 5 years. The Green line also was modernized within the past 10 years.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Barriers to High Speed Rail in the US</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=653</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="240" caption="Photo of high speed rail in Taiwan by dhchen"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dhchen/"><img title="Taiwan High Speed Rail" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/58/353927040_49bba2e234_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160" /></a>[/caption]

The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/12/us/12rail.html">New York Times had an interesting article </a>over the weekend on the state of Florida's recent rejection of federal money to build a high speed rail line between Orlando and Tampa.

This comes on the heels of gubernatorial elections in Wisconsin and Ohio where anti-rail governors who were elected last year similarly <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/09/wisconsin-highspeed-rail-_n_794721.html">rejected federal money</a>.

In spite of the fact that there is<a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/04/06/Poll-Half-of-US-backs-high-speed-rail/UPI-63741270598738/"> strong public support</a> for high speed rail and that rail and public transit have a <a href="http://climateprogress.org/2010/11/17/high-speed-rail/">positive economic impact</a>, the development of this key infrastructure is stagnating.

What are the reasons for this stagnation--particularly when governments overseeing advanced and growing economies in Europe and Asia have less problems generating political consensus around this public investment?

My sense is that much of the problem can be attributed to two factors: 1) the lack of a real coherent national transportation policy and 2) the peculiar decision-making structure of our federalist system.

The second point is quite apparent given the outlandish power that single states have to negatively impact regional plans.   This stems from the fact that the federal government largely defers to states to determine their transportation plans.  In terms of capital improvements like high-speed rail,  states determine plans and <a href="https://ntl.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/447/~/eligibility-issues-for-recovery-act-funds-%28railroad%29">federal money is allocated to the extent that projects conform to state plans</a>.

This, of course, is reflective of the first point: the federal government does not have a proper "national plan" nor does it engage in the crucial decision making necessary to implement a serious national rail vision.

Sure, the USDOT develops national plans, but they are secondary to the states when it comes to rail.  In the words of the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBUQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fra.dot.gov%2Fdownloads%2Frailplanprelim10-15.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=national%20rail%20planning%20&amp;ei=nMt_Tf25J6WG0QGeu5zzCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGF0yJZLVhZV59nnSTUWQ4SxhuO6w&amp;cad=rja">2009 National Rail Plan [pdf]</a>, the legislative mandate for USDOT planning is "to develop the plan consistent with approved State plans" (23)--not vice versa.

This distinction is crucial.  How can you have a national infrastructure system which is the product of 50 bottom-up decisions.  We can see the impact this might have in a region like the Midwest, where states like Illinois and Minnesota will be negatively impacted by unilateral decisions made in Ohio and Wisconsin.

The feds could deal with this barrier, but it won't be easy.  Congress would have to pass legislation restricting state autonomy--something that wouldn't have much support in the current political climate in Washington.

Until this happens, however, high speed rail is likely to be stuck on a slow track.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Climate negotiators from throughout the world are in Panama this week for the last negotiating session before December's major Conference of the Parties (COP) meeting in Durban.

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="240" caption="Delegates Arrive for Climate Talks in Panama (photo: adoptanegotiator)"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adoptanegotiator/"><img title="Panama Climate Talks" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6002/6205623267_7d7547199b_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160" /></a>[/caption]

Last year's COP in Cancun ended on a cautiously optimistic note as the explicit gridlock and petulance that marked the 2009 Copenhagen summit was avoided and a series of "agreements" emerged that would put negotiations on a path forward towards a new global treaty.

So where are we on the eve of Durban? Has there been significant progress towards substantive agreements? Or did the non-committal nature of the Cancun Agreements merely  <a href="http://www.boell.de/ecology/climate/climate-energy-analysis-climate-summit-cancun-11142.html">temporarily avoid</a> the need for  confronting critical differences between countries?

The two negotiating tracks are still proceeding--one dealing with what happens when the Kyoto Protocol's first emissions reductions commitment period ends next year (AWG-KP) and another dealing with "long term commitments" for countries, like the United States and China, that are not bound by Kyoto's reduction pledges (AWG-LCA).

On the Kyoto side, several Kyoto-bound developed country emitters like Japan, Canada, and Russia have insisted that they will not sign on to another commitment period under the current situation.

Developing countries, led by China, are <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2114714/g77-china-insists-continuation-kyoto-protocol-negotiation">still insisting that the Kyoto must proceed with a second commitment period</a>. This has led the European Union to say that they are willing to consider a second round of emissions reductions only if it is part of a "broader package."

They argue that since EU emissions are around 11% of the global share, their unilateral actions will not have the impact needed to stave off dangerous climate change.

On the AWG-LCA track, there still doesn't seem to be anything concrete to have emerged yet that bridges the concerns of the major developing countries and the United States.  One of the major features of the Cancun Agreements was that countries--developed and developing--would voluntarily list their emissions reduction strategies in a public fashion and that there should be some way that any emissions reductions could be independently verified.  Also related to this is the crucial issue of financial mechanisms for developing countries to help transition to a low-carbon economy.  Developing countries are critical of developed countries' focus on how climate finance funding might operate to the exclusion of  a discussion of monetary commitments.

How these logjams will be cleared is difficult to ascertain at this point.  Over the past few days in Panama, it appears that there has been a flurry of documents and <a href="http://unfccc.int/documentation/documents/advanced_search/items/3594.php?such=j&amp;keywords=%22conference+papers%22#beg">"conference room papers</a>"  circulating where countries are staking out positions.

The Panama conference ends tomorrow, so we should have a sense of where things are headed going into Durban within the next 24 hours.  The European Union was hoping for a "roadmap" towards a legal agreement to be adopted in Durban.  That would surely be progress.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UN Climate Negotiator: &quot;We do not belive conditions are ripe&quot; for legal agreement in Durban</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The last intersessional international climate negotiations before the major conference in Durban ended today in Panama with modest progress made on some issues like the structure of a financing mechanism to help poor countries cope with climate change.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="240" caption="US climate negiotiator Jonathan Pershing. photo: US Department of State"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/statephotos/"><img title="Pershing in Cancun" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5081/5219236330_b81865bb36_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="159" /></a>[/caption]

But major movement on what to do when the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period ends next year and how to bring large emitters like the United States and China into an agreement on long-term emissions reduction actions has remained elusive.

At <a href="http://unfccc2.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/111001_AWG/templ/play.php?id_kongresssession=4034&amp;theme=unfccc">his closing press conference</a>, US lead negotiator, Jonathan Pershing, said that his country does "not believe conditions are ripe for a mandate in Durban for a legally binding agreement.  For our part we can only consider an agreement with equal legal force to all the major economies."

This means that the US will not engage in anything legally binding without developing country emitters like China and India agreeing to binding reductions in the growth of their emissions as well.

Those emerging economic powers, however, are quite content with the Kyoto architecture which creates a two-tier system whereby the historic Western emitters are solely responsible for reductions.

At <a href="http://unfccc2.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/111001_AWG/templ/ovw_onDemand.php?id_kongressmain=191#">the closing plenary</a> developing country after developing country argued for a continuation of Kyoto after its 2012 expiration.

Going into Durban, the expectations have got to be modest.  The <a href="http://unfccc.int/documentation/documents/advanced_search/items/3594.php?rec=j&amp;priref=600006550&amp;suchen=n">negotiating text on what to do with Kyoto</a> is an unwieldy 49 pages long with such divergent options that it seems <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/15/world/15climate.html">like the accounts of the 2007 Bali conference</a> could equally apply to the proceedings in Panama.

Pershing tried to be upbeat at his news conference today about the financing architecture that is taking form, but on the fundamental issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions he observed:  "I don't see any meeting of the minds of the issues."]]></content:encoded>

The 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change begins tomorrow in Durban, South Africa.

For several years now the world's governments have been trying to develop a comprehensive treaty to address the climate problem and the shortcomings of the Kyoto Protocol.   Very little progress has been made.

There are many obstacles to be cleared.  One of the most intractable is the desire on the part of the United States to insure that developing countries take actions to reduce the growth of their emissions in such a way that they can be objectively verified.

For developing countries such as China and India, they respond that the United States is a large historic emitter and that they expect action from the developed world before they will consider any legal instrument inhibiting their own emission growth.

Over the past several weeks countries have been presenting draft papers of language that they would like to see in any agreement coming out of Durban.

Today some of these texts were released to the public.  The offerings from China, India, and Brazil on the one hand, and the United States, on the other, don't give much hope in terms of bridging the political gaps between the developed world and the major emerging economies.

The United States offered a <a href="http://unfccc.int/documentation/documents/advanced_search/items/3594.php?rec=j&amp;priref=600006643&amp;data=&amp;title=&amp;author=&amp;keywords=&amp;symbol=&amp;meeting=&amp;mo_from=&amp;year_from=&amp;mo_to=&amp;year_to=&amp;last_days=60&amp;anf=0&amp;sorted=date_sort&amp;dirc=DESC&amp;seite=1#beg">text</a> on "long-term finance"--which refers to the ways in which rich countries will help developing countries advance their economies in a low-carbon manner.  Instead of focusing on how specific financing commitments will be raised and delivered, the text is much more concerned with the "transparency" issue.

The <a href="http://unfccc.int/documentation/documents/advanced_search/items/3594.php?rec=j&amp;priref=600006535&amp;data=&amp;title=&amp;author=&amp;keywords=&amp;symbol=&amp;meeting=&amp;mo_from=&amp;year_from=&amp;mo_to=&amp;year_to=&amp;last_days=60&amp;anf=0&amp;sorted=date_sort&amp;dirc=DESC&amp;seite=1#beg">text offered</a> by China, India and Brazil is short and to the point:
<blockquote>
Acknowledging that the largest share of historical global emissions of greenhouse gases originated in Annex I Parties and that, owing to this historical responsibility in terms of their contribution to the average global temperature increase, Annex I Parties must take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof.

Also acknowledging that, according to the preamble of the Convention, social and economic development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of developing countries.

The work towards identifying a global goal for substantially reducing global greenhouse gas emissions as well as a timeframe for global peaking of emissions must be based on historical responsibility as referred above, bearing in mind the context of enhancing and achieving the full, effective and sustained
implementation of the Convention.</blockquote>
In essence, these three large and growing economies are saying that the developed countries are largely responsible for creating the problem and, hence, should be the first to exhibit behaviors that will help alleviate rising emissions levels.

Neither of these positions are surprising.  However, after four years of negotiations the fact that there is no evidence of spaces for agreement is troubling.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Evanston, Illinois' City Council approved a <a href="http://www.cityofevanston.org/assets/CCAP%207-9-12%20ce%20final.pdf">planning grant application</a> (see pg. 271 of the .pdf) last week that will provide funding for a Transit Oriented Development Plan at<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=main+st.+and+chicago+Ave.+Evanston+IL&amp;ll=42.033887,-87.679374&amp;spn=0.000982,0.002148&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;hnear=Main+St+%26+Chicago+Ave,+Evanston,+Cook,+Illinois+60202&amp;gl=us&amp;t=h&amp;z=19"> Main and Chicago Avenues</a>.

It is a logical place for TOD given that the intersection is served both by a CTA EL line and Metra's regional commuter rail.  The neighborhood is walkable, mixed use, and has a nice variety of small businesses.  One problem that the new plan will likely attempt to alleviate is the poor pedestrian connections between the two stations.<a href="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screenshot-from-2012-07-18-1013491.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-682" title="Main and Chicago, Evanston" src="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screenshot-from-2012-07-18-1013491-300x248.png" alt="" width="300" height="248" /></a>  As it stands now, folks making transfers have to go around the block and walk under a dark viaduct.  There are no wayfinding signs at either station,  so those unfamiliar with the area often have trouble navigating transfers.  A more transit-friendly plan could open up the space between the stations for transfers.

More intriguing to me in the memo was a desire to explore a "highline" concept for bikes and pedestrians in the railroads' right-of-way.  The staff memo cites the very popular <a href="http://www.thehighline.org/">Highline</a> project in New York which converted an unused elevated rail line into an elevated park.  Chicago is currently planning its own elevated park with its 3-mile Bloomingdale Trail project that will link Logan Square with Goose Island using an abandoned elevated rail corridor.

Evanston would be a great site for a similar project as there is ample space between the Metra and CTA tracks that is currently underutilized.  Th<a href="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screenshot-from-2012-07-18-102251.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-684" title="Evanston's Highline?" src="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Screenshot-from-2012-07-18-102251-300x210.png" alt="" width="300" height="210" /></a>e photo on the right shows the current state of the space between the two rail lines which offers a few  long-term parking spaces but otherwise is a "dead zone" of activity.  Furthermore, the two rail lines run parallel on a berm roughly from the city's southern border  two miles north to the center of downtown.

It would be an easy and relatively inexpensive project to have a Highline the entire stretch of rail corridor.  This would improve bike mobility immensely as a safe and convenient North-South connection could entice cyclists who are uncomfortable with riding on Chicago Avenue.

It is not inconceivable to see this project as the opening section of an eventual <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/world/europe/in-denmark-pedaling-to-work-on-a-superhighway.html?_r=1&amp;src=me&amp;ref=world">"bike superhighway"</a> alongside the Metra berm connecting Evanston with downtown Chicago 12 miles away.]]></content:encoded>

The company was purchased by Google last May and will be moving 3000 jobs to the historic building.

From an urban development standpoint this move is instructive since the head of Motorola deliberately sited the urban environment as an advantage to their business given the new site's ample crowds and public transit being a natural laboratory in which to observe how consumers interact with mobile technology.

From an urban planning standpoint it could be used as evidence that the dense, multi-modal environment that you get in a city is an amenity for business and economic growth.  In addition, Motorola sees the urban setting as advantageous to recruit and retain good talent.

Suburbs like Libertyville simply can't compete with the social and physical infrastructure of Chicago.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Does Obama Still Support Cap and Trade?</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=707</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 26 Oct 2012 17:26:41 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[admin]]></dc:creator>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[An <a href="http://t.co/o5JVmZF3">article in today's New York Times</a> discusses how the issue of climate change has been conspicuously absent from the recent US presidential debates and the candidates' stump speeches.

<a href="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Obamacap.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-708" title="Obamacap" src="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Obamacap.png" alt="" width="501" height="270" /></a>Speaking of the president's position, the article indicates that "after a bill died in the Senate in 2010, Mr. Obama abandoned his support for cap and trade, a market-based method to limit greenhouse gas emissions."

It is clear that Obama supported cap-and-trade during his 2008 campaign and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nec/StrategyforAmericanInnovation/">pushed for Congress to pass such legislation early in his term</a>.  But it is also true that the issue also took back seat to other policy initiatives like health care and that key advisers like former <a href="http://www.good.is/posts/bye-bye-rahm-it-s-nice-to-see-you-go-1/">Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel actively discouraged</a> elevating climate policy to the top of the president's agenda.

But has he really "abandoned support" for cap and trade?

The idea is not mentioned on the White House energy website and does not appear in the 2011 "<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/blueprint_secure_energy_future.pdf">Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future</a>."  A search for "cap and trade" on his <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/search?q=%22cap+and+trade%22&amp;source_codes=primary-nav-see-more">campaign website reveals</a> "No Results."

However, the White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/divisions/energyenvironment">Office of Science and Technology Policy is still touting cap and trade</a> as a goal of the administration and <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/219753-obama-cap-and-trade-was-a-republican-idea">earlier this year Obama acknowledged</a> "cap and trade" as a position he supported.  Even without cap and trade the administration <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/25/was-u-s-climate-policy-better-off-without-cap-and-trade/">has still moved forward</a> with increased fuel economy standards for cars and regulations on coal power plants and carbon emissions have, indeed, decreased during the course of his first term.

Nevertheless, the issue of climate change isn't going away and how the candidates propose to address it need to be more clearly articulated.

		<title>Assessing the US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement: Highland Park, IL</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been about eight years since Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels challenged his fellow mayors to sign the US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement which  would pledge each signatory to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their town by 7% of 1990 levels by 2012.

While over 1000 mayors  signed the agreement, for most cities little is known about what was accomplished.  An <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/suburbs/highland_park_deerfield/ct-tl-lk-0801-highland-park-carbon-emissions-20130730,0,6138905.story">article in today's Chicago Tribune</a> discusses the Chicago suburb of Highland Park--an affluent community on the shores of Lake Michigan north of the city--and its experience with the USMCPA .

The former mayor signed the agreement in 2005 and, according to a new city council member Kim Stone, nothing systematic was done to realize the emissions reduction.

In fact, the first step needed to understand a community's emissions potential--a baseline emissions inventory--was never undertaken.  Stone chalks up the signing of the pledge as symbolic according to the article.

Having done some research on this topic of implementing climate action after signing the USMCPA, I can say that Highland Park's experience is not atypical.  Many small municipalities simply don't have the technical background or resources to conduct such an analysis.

This isn't to say that the municipalities do nothing.  The article on Highland Park notes several measures relating to energy efficiency in buildings and vehicles that the city has implemented.

However, the advantage of a specific target is that progress can more easily be assessed.  As it stands Stone and the city staff are looking into ways to develop measurable changes.   It will be interesting to follow how they proceed.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Evanston and Oak Park Explore Participating in Chicago Bike Share Scheme</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's been about six weeks since Chicago's Divvy Bike Share scheme went online.  With 144 stations, over <a href="http://divvybikes.tumblr.com/post/57526992915/yay-were-a-little-over-a-month-old-and-heres">100,000 trips taken</a> and 4,000 annual memberships sold, Divvy bikes are  quickly becoming ubiquitous on the streets of downtown Chicago and its inner-ring neighborhoods.

Bike share's ability to be a cheap, convenient, and environmentally-friendly element of a city's transportation system is not being lost on a couple of Chicago's contiguous suburbs: Oak Park and Evanston.  According to a <a href="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/EvanstonBikeShareStaffMemo.pdf">staff memo released on Friday</a>, Evanston and Oak Park are teaming up with Chicago to apply for federal money under the <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/map21/guidance/guidetap.cfm">Transportation Alternatives Program</a> to fund new Divvy stations.

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="400"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/publicworksgroup/"><img alt="" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5343/9379391911_f8dda8d2b7.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></a> Divvy Bikes in Chicago, photo: Pam Broviak[/caption]

Expanding the Divvy system to the suburbs is a positive idea, but there are many questions raised by the implementation plan proposed by Evanston.  I have not been able to find any information from Oak Park about their plans, so I will focus on Evanston.

Here are the key points:

- The plan calls for 7 stations and 70 bikes to be placed in the city.

- The TAP grant calls for a 20% share of the total capital project costs from the city which would be $94,000

-  While the memo doesn't explicitly endorse sources of funding, it does mention the Parking Fund as a possibility.   The Parking Fund raises revenues through managing the city's parking infrastructure and currently <a href="http://www.cityofevanston.org/assets/06-30-13%20Financial%20Reports_Signed_for%20Posting.pdf">has a cash balance </a>of around $16,000,000 and has earned about $1.7 million in profit this year.  They also plan on shaking down Northwestern University and the "city's other large employers" for assistance on both the capital and operations side.

-  They project annual revenues of $44,000 from casual users and $75,000 from annual members.  This comes $49,000 short of their projected costs.  It is important to note that it is not uncommon for subsidies to be needed to meet operating costs of bike share schemes (just like subsidies are needed for road infrastructure and public transit).

From the standpoint of applying for a capital grant that will fund 80% of project costs and using the Parking Fund to make up the difference, the plan is laudable.   Using funds generated from managing cars--which extract a disproportionate social cost than other forms of mobility--to subsidize a cheaper, lower impact form of mobility is smart.

However, the plan has some serious problems which could negatively impact the program's effectiveness in Evanston.

First, the location and number of stations is a bit problematic.  The memo states that this proposal would "expand bike share north" from Chicago.  Read literally, this is true.  However, the siting of the closest proposed station to the Chicago border is about 2 miles and four miles to the northernmost proposed Divvy station in Chicago.  The distance between the proposed Evanston network and Chicago is too great to really think of it as a network--which is essential for making bike sharing attractive to consumers.<a href="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ProposedBikeShareEvanston.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-729 alignright" alt="ProposedBikeShareEvanston" src="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ProposedBikeShareEvanston-300x300.png" width="300" height="300" /></a>

Without being integrated within the larger Divvy network, you will essentially have a stand-alone system of 7 stations.  A system this small is very hard to sustain.  A feasibility study done by Divvy's operator for Cincinnati mentioned 10 stations as a minimum.  With seven stations, the system loses its attractiveness for potential users.  The map at the right shows the proposed locations (<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=203521461534479763793.0004e3b8690dac8aa295c&amp;msa=0">click here for the kiosks pinned on a google map</a>).

Three are directly adjacent to transit stations--which is good (Central St. Metra, Central St. CTA, and Davis St. CTA).  It is essential to be intermodal.  But once you get off the train you have to go somewhere!   The four non-transit stop kiosks are 1) on Northwestern University's campus, 2) near the beach at Lake Michigan (also close to a couple of Northwestern dorms), 3) City Hall, and 4) Downtown Evanston (about 500 feet from the Davis CTA stop and another proposed kiosk).

The idea behind bike share is that it is designed to help cities solve the "last mile" problem.  Once a person's destination--like a transit stop or a grocery store--is more than 1/4-1/2 mile away, the likelihood that they will walk diminishes significantly.  You can't build trains to get within a 1/4 mile of where everyone lives or needs to go.  But scattering bikes around most cities is quite feasible.

With only 7 stations, however, you are really limiting the possibilities and attractiveness of the system.  Is it likely that someone will choose a bike share to go from the Central St. Metra Station to the Central St. CTA station? The linkages from Northwestern to Downtown Evanston should be popular--especially to the transit hub at Davis.  However, key Downtown student destinations like Whole Foods are overlooked in favor of Rotary International.  Rotary is a major employer and generates many trips (and singled out as a possible source of funding in the memo).  But people who work there are not likely to live close to a bike share kiosk.

We have to be mindful of budgets which is why such a modest system is being proposed and that brings us to the annual revenue generation assumptions: $44,000 from casual users and $75,000 from annual member fees.  It is a bit unclear how these numbers were generated.  In the feasibility studies done by Divvy's operator, Alta, I've seen  for other cities, they normally estimate numbers of users per category rather than revenue generated per type of user.

These assumptions are important as they can help determine the financial sustainability of operations.  In tourist-heavy cities like Washington DC large numbers of casual users can help pay for system costs.   The data is still premature, but in Chicago I would think that a significant percentage of casual users are tourists.  We would not expect the same percentages in Evanston.

It is hard to know how to assess this proposal.  I recognize the municipality is working within budget constraints (although that didn't stop the city council from giving a <a href="http://evanstonnow.com/story/government/bill-smith/2012-05-08/49488/evanston-aldermen-ok-trader-joes-parking-deal">German company $2 million</a> of Parking Fund revenues last year to build a parking lot for their store).  But if there are only 7 kiosks, will there be enough Northwestern student support to make the scheme financially feasible?  The fear is that if the roll-out is too modest, it could stain public perception and set bike sharing back in the city.

<span style="color: #ff0000;">update 15 Aug. 2013: City Council approved the measure unanimously to apply for the grant.  During council deliberations aldermen representing districts that were not included in the pilot expressed concern that their constituents were being left out of the pilot.  The City Manager seemed to agree that staff would include at least one additional station on Howard Street and Custer (I believe).</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Evanston Approves Bike Share Grant Application; Modifies Station Map</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After tough questioning by City Council members over the proposed placement of bike share stations to deployed as part of a pilot project to extend Divvy to Evanston, the Council gave the go-ahead to pursue the grant but significantly changed the station locations.<a href="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/EvanstonBikePilotLocations.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-740" alt="EvanstonBikePilotLocations" src="http://hughbartling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/EvanstonBikePilotLocations-284x300.png" width="284" height="300" /></a>

The original plan to have just seven stations has been increased to eight.  The proposed station at city hall will be moved to a largely residential neighborhood six  blocks adjacent to a community center while one of the downtown stations (Sherman &amp; Grove) will be moved  .5 mile south to Chicago Ave. and Greenleaf where Jewel Foods and Whole Foods are situated.  This station will also be a block away from a new Trader Joe's food market.  The eighth station will be situated on the Chicago border at Howard St. and Chicago Avenue, one block from the Howard CTA stop.

The new map and the additions are an improvement on the initial effort.  However, the number of stations is still inadequate and the western part of the city is still excluded.  One thing that is not clear following the council meeting is just how the pilot is going to be evaluated.  If this is an initial foray to work out the kinks and get residents and visitors familiar with the system and that the ultimate goal is for the city to properly implement bike share, it is probably a workable map.  It's another matter if they are going to gauge interest based on usage numbers, because the saturation is not adequate to properly assess citizen interest.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Nations Stake Positions in Advance of Warsaw Climate Conference</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the outcomes of last year's UN climate conference in Doha was to ramp up negotiations this year in anticipation of a new legal climate agreement to be signed in 2015.

In an effort to avoid the debacle of Copenhagen, when the proposed treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol  failed to materialize and the international climate negotiations nearly ground to a halt, the parties developed a new negotiation track in 2011 dubbed the <a href="http://unfccc.int/bodies/body/6645.php">Ad-hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action</a> [ADP].  The group has been conducting <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/warsaw_nov_2013/session/7730/php/view/workshops.php">workshops </a>this year designed to be a more informal and transparent vehicle for fostering conversation between parties.

In advance of this year's major meeting in Warsaw, parties have been submitting <a href="http://unfccc.int/bodies/awg/items/7398.php">documents stating their visions</a> for a 2015 agreement.  Although the negotiations over an actual text won't commence until next year, the stands being taken now are illustrative of the potential viability of any treaty that may emerge in 2015.

A couple of points are interesting.  From the <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/documentation/submissions_from_parties/adp/application/pdf/adp_usa_workstream_1_20131017.pdf">United States</a>, we see a rather tepid statement which envisions "a mix of provisions that are legally binding and non-legally binding" and continues to rely on voluntary emissions targets from countries.  Glaringly omitted is any mention of the need to keep global temperature rise to 2 degrees by 2050--which was a key feature of the <a href="http://maindb.unfccc.int/library/view_pdf.pl?url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/cop15/eng/11a01.pdf">Copenhagen Accord</a>.

Given the fact that there have been several <a href="http://www.unep.org/publications/ebooks/emissionsgap2012/">analyses</a> written since Copenhagen analyzing the gap between voluntary pledges and what the science tells us is necessary to address the 2 degree target, the US position is a bit troubling.  Essentially the US is sticking to its position in Copenhagen and ignoring the reality of science-based risk assessments agreed upon in subsequent negotiating sessions.

On the other hand, the European Union's latest series of statements puts the 2 degree target at the forefront.  They offer a <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/documentation/submissions_from_parties/adp/application/pdf/adp_eu_workstream_1_mitigation_20130916.pdf">timetable </a>to get us to a legally-binding agreement by 2015.  One of the features of this timetable is that all countries present specific reduction targets in 2014 that they will be legally bound to in a final agreement.

From the large developing country perspective, <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/documentation/submissions_from_parties/adp/application/pdf/adp_india_workstream_1_20130913.pdf">India emphasizes</a> the need to maintain the distinction between developing and developed countries that was enshrined in the Kyoto Protocol and situates finance coming from the developed countries as a requirement for developing country emissions reduction targets.

None of these positions are really new.  Aside from the EU--which has the clearest articulation for a scientifically-oriented agreement--the others seem to be treading water making it unclear if 2015 will be a breakthrough or simply Copenhagen redux.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Why Drivers Should Embrace Bike Share? It Expands Parking Capacity</title>
		<link>http://hughbartling.com/?p=751</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With bike share schemes being implemented in the past year in Chicago, New York, and San Francisco it seems like this new form of public transportation is taking hold in the United States.  Often billed as a solution to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile_(transport)">"last mile"</a> problem, bike share allows an inexpensive and low-impact way of dispersing public transportation options, enhancing accessibility to transit hubs and other destinations.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="463"]<img class="  " alt="" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/84f405c931fb410cdb74cee827fe2d7c/tumblr_mw31ksWj5T1qa8b36o1_1280.png" width="463" height="382" /> Quarter mile walk[/caption]

One critique we hear about bike share relates to the location of the kiosks--particularly when they are placed on the street where car parking was previously allowed.  People see <a href="http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/35/21/dtg_bikeparking_2012_05_25_bk.html">"scarce"</a> parking being sacrificed for the bike scheme and <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20130802/wicker-park/small-businesses-on-divvy-less-parking-but-potentially-more-traffic">businesses often are concerned</a> about how a kiosk might impact accessibility.

Positioning biking and bike share as necessarily anti-automobile is misguided.  In fact, one could argue that it could help disperse parking, alleviating congestion and wasteful efforts circling blocks looking for a place to park.

I'll give my own commute as an example.  My office is situated in transit-friendly, mixed-use neighborhood of Lincoln Park in Chicago.  Probably about 80% of the time I either commute by bike or train from my home 8.5 miles away.  Sometimes, however, I need to drive.  The university charges $7 to park, which can be avoided by finding a place to park on the street.  The commercial streets are geared towards short-term metered parking, but one can sometimes find street-parking in the neighborhood.  In general I feel good if I can park within a five minute walk of the office, after that point <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_decay">"distance decay"</a> sets in and the attractiveness of driving declines the further I get from my destination.

With the introduction of Divvy bike share in the neighborhood, however, the "five minute" rule of accessibility gets expanded.  I no longer really care about parking within a five minute walk of my destination; if I can get within a five minute bike ride I am satisfied.  With a bike kiosk in front of my office, my parking universe grows.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="463"]<img class="  " alt="" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/64568315731ec84f90e9cf562ca4d832/tumblr_mw31ksWj5T1qa8b36o2_1280.png" width="463" height="382" /> Quarter-mile and three-quarter mile buffers[/caption]

Just for fun, I did a network analysis of the quarter mile buffer around my office, which is about how far the average person can walk in five minutes.  Because the campus is in the way, my parking options are more limited than normal and I really need to park within 2-3 blocks in order to make my walk to the office clock in at under five minutes.

The second map shows the same analysis with a three-quarter mile buffer, which is about how far the average person could bike in five minutes.  As you can see, there are more than a dozen Divvy kiosks within my five-minute bike ride area.  The further one is removed from the university and the major thoroughfares of Lincoln Ave. and Fullerton Ave., the more parking becomes available.  As long as I am able to park relatively close to a Divvy kiosk, I can get to work within the 5 minute threshold.

I would imagine that as the network grows, there will be more opportunities for dispersed parking strategies in Chicago's neighborhoods.  If you drive in Chicago and want to spend less money on parking, get a bike share membership.

		<title>How Sprawling is Your Neighborhood? Chicago Metro Edition</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier this year <a href="http://gis.cancer.gov/tools/urban-sprawl/">Reid Ewing and Shima Hamidi released the latest version of their urban sprawl index</a>.  The first version came out a decade or so ago and the latest version uses current data and has an improved methodology.

The index came out of the fact that commentators, scholars, policymakers, and journalists would constantly talk about "sprawl" without there being an authoritative definition of the phenomenon.  <a href="http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/research/measuring-sprawl-and-its-impact/">Ewing and his colleagues set out to change this in 2002</a> by developing an index of sprawl that draws on objective data relating to population and employment density, the mixture of uses and destinations apparent, the presence of urban centers, and the connectivity of street systems.

The 2002 study defined its index at the level of county and metropolitan areas.  The current effort added sprawl scores at the census tract level for the largest urbanized areas in the United States allowing for greater detail in analyzing patterns of sprawl and metropolitan development.

The map below reflects the sprawl indices for metropolitan census tracts in Illinois.  Higher scores indicate more density and less sprawl.
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?q=select+col17+from+1dmQxIkcE-L_Maq7iQSWzgddGhQ2F1-Lr1lpLwPYE+where+col16+%3E%3D+20+and+col16+%3C%3D+272&amp;viz=MAP&amp;h=false&amp;lat=41.85573784066552&amp;lng=-87.79003427563475&amp;t=1&amp;z=11&amp;l=col17&amp;y=2&amp;tmplt=2&amp;hml=GEOCODABLE" width="600" height="600" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe>

There are obvious patterns of density around transit lines, however it is interesting to see the north/south differences within the City of Chicago which probably reflect disparities in mix of jobs and destinations.  Also notable are the numerous suburban centers which score high on the index.  This could be promising for thinking about the viability of sprawl mitigation policies.  Such efforts as higher-density and mixed-use development in the Chicago suburbs could take advantage of an existing social, economic and physical infrastructure to help slow sprawl regionally.]]></content:encoded>
