      <title>The Economy and Social Work</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/4/the-economy-and-social-work</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the worldwide, national, state, and local economies facing an economic downturn, it is important to examine its effects on social service agencies and social work. The active policy of how economic downturns effect social service agencies is examined though a number of modalities. When looking at these types of policies the affected populations must be described. The historical, worldwide, national, and statewide perspectives provide context and understanding of the problem. A policy analysis matrix is also utilized to give a more concrete description of the crisis.</p>

      <title>Still in The Right Profession</title>

<p>As my avid blog readers (I think with all the time my site was down, there are probably none... LOL) probably already know I love <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a>. I'm always listening to it in the car all day (unless I'm bumping some <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(entertainer)">Drake</a>). Last night as I was getting off work, late as normal, and driving home. NPR had a really amazing story on. It was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/2011/10/25/141672992/native-foster-care-lost-children-shattered-families"><em>Native Foster Care: Lost Children, Shattered Families</em></a>. It was very informative and powerful. I think I teared up a little bit.As I was driving home, and being impacted by this powerful story, it reminded me of what one of my professors told us one time. We were watching some pretty upsetting videos, and she (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ewu.edu/CSBSSW/Programs/Social-Work/Social-Work-Faculty/Mary-Ann-Clute.xml">Mary Ann Clute</a>) told us the day that hearing some of these stories no longer effect us is the day we should change professions. I guess listening to to this story makes me realize that I really am still in the right profession.That's a great big "Job Well Done" to me.</p><p>If your curious about what the percentage of Native American Children are in the foster care system in your state, check out the map below or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/2011/10/25/141475618/disproportionality-rates-of-native-american-children-in-foster-care">Disproportionality Rates of Native American Children In Foster Care</a>.</p><iframe width="100%" height="500px" frameBorder="0" src="http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v2/npr.foster-kids-v2/mm/zoompan,tooltips,legend,share,zoomwheel,zoombox,attribution.html#4/40.699361630693005/-90.24172031249992"></iframe>]]></content:encoded>

It is pretty amazing. I absolutely loved it...hopefully some day, I can make artwork of a similar quality. [/caption] 
  

<p>On Saturday, I got the opportunity to attend <a href="http://myfriendsplace.info/">My Friends Place's</a> Fundraiser called the Lawyer's and Artist's Ball 2011. It was a pretty amazing event. I have been lucky to be able to be on the committee to start My Friends Place (you can also check out the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.causes.com/causes/611545-myfriendsplace">My Friends Place Cause Page</a>. My Friends Place is both a non-profit organization and a program of <a target="_blank" href="http://crisis-nursery.org/">Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery</a>. It has been quite a process and I have been loving the opportunity to be a part of something big and a great need for our community!The event went wonderfully. There were tons of great costumes and I think we raised a lot of money. You can check out the photos I took (I wish I had taken more) in my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.601596444186.2084849.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=6151ac05cd">Facebook Album Lawyer's &amp; Artist's Ball 2011 Album</a>. It was impacting to hear the story one man told about his son who recently died... but had previously been homeless. We found out that he and his family had donated $10,000.00, which is enough to open the doors as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

"/>  I photo of Minnie at Kadlec Regional Medical Center in Richland our baby Mateo Rodman Campbell, VSP and me. [/caption] 
  

<p>We just wanted to update everybody, and let you all know that Minnie and I just had our baby. Minnie had gone in to her regular weekly check up with her doctor. Our pregnancy has been high risk due to the baby only having two arteries in the umbilical cord. While she was there doing the ultra sound they said that during her BBP testing only barely passed. She was put on a heart monitor and they said that he had "decels." Basically that his heart beat was slowing down.</p>

<p>They sent her to Kadlec Regional Hospital to follow up. I left work at about 5 and headed that way to. by 5:45 she had been seen by the doctor and they told her that they were going to preform a C-Section. At 6:43 PM in Richland Washington on 12/27/12 "Mateo Rodman Campbell VSP" was born weighing 7 pounds 9.6 ounces and 20 inches. He was born three and half weeks early from our due date. He is healthy and we will be hanging out in the Hospital for the next couple of days. I'm sure I will write more with lots of cute little stories to tell and pictures to share.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Probably Time to Eat My Wheaties</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/7/probably-time-to-eat-my-wheaties</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="509.0"]<a href="http://www.feedourfamilies.com/2013/03/celebrities-encourage-junk-food-for-kids.html"  target="_blank" ><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/53ca3971e4b02facb93db796/1405761910932/Michael-Jordon-Wheaties-Box.jpg" alt=" One of Michael Jordan's boxes of Wheaties.&nbsp; "/></a>  One of Michael Jordan's boxes of Wheaties.&nbsp; [/caption] 
  

<p>Well, it's almost two as I am decided to get up because I couldn't shut my mind off, so I decided to get up and write. Just one of those nights when you just can't unwind and fall comfortably into a deep and restful sleep. Currently we are in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyallup,_Washington">Puyallup</a> and getting ready to go to Orlando Florida for <a href="http://www.cadca.org/">CADCA</a>'s 2014 <a href="http://midyear.cadca.org/">Mid Year Conference</a>. I'm super excited, although somewhat worried about how <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/?tag=Mateo+Campbell">Mateo</a> will do on on the red eye flight tomorrow night. Here's hoping that he sleeps.</p>

<p>As I sit here thinking about how I can't sleep, I'm reminded of the Wheaties commercials from the 80's and 90's:</p>

<p>I feel like maybe I haven't been eating enough of my Wheaties lately, if by Wheaties I mean not overwhelming myself with having too much on my plate, keeping everything organized (generally in a <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD</a> fashion). It feels like I just have so many things that I have coming up this fall and things that I need to get ready for.</p><figure >

<p>With <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2014/7/positive-life-transition-did-somebody-say-summer">changing jobs to the Pasco School District</a>, I have a <a href="https://www.ets.org/praxis/about/praxisii">PRAXIS II</a> exam that I need to start studying for, along with a training and just getting ready to change positions. Along with that, I am still trying to manage my current clients, follow up with all of them before I transition and determine if they will be transferred to a therapist, to whoever gets hired as a new case manager, or if they just need to be closed.</p><p>More than the PRAXIS II, I'm also going to be eligible to take my test for my <a href="http://www.socialworklicensure.org/state/social-work-licensure-washington.html">clinical social work</a> license this fall. While these tests and changes are in the back of my mind, they are not anything that has priority right now. My focus the last couple of weeks has been the two new classes I'm going to be teaching at <a href="http://www.heritage.edu/AcademicPrograms/UndergraduateDegrees/SocialWork.aspx">Heritage</a> this fall. I taught case management last Fall, but it was an online course. I decided that it would be a better format to have it be an in class format, which means I'm having to go through and revamp the course completely. I am really excited about it, and have really enjoyed my time teaching in the past, it's just a lot of work.</p><p>Going to Florida for a week is going to be a lot of fun with some great learning experiences, but also feels like a lot in the midst of everything. You can rest assured that I will be writing up some posts about my time there and the conference. I might even be able to get around to the book that I brought with me to read, but we will have to see about that one. I can say one thing for sure, when I get back, I'm going to have to buckle down and eat my Wheaties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Wintertime DIY Painted Mirror</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/11/the-wintertime-diy-painted-mirror</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1024.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/5292e323e4b03e7a072a517c/1385358118036/wintertime-DIY-painted-mirror.jpg" alt=" Made in the  Diptic App  on my mac. &nbsp;Wintertime DIY Painted Mirror "/>  Made in the  Diptic App  on my mac. &nbsp;Wintertime DIY Painted Mirror [/caption] 
  

<p>Painting during the wintertime is a hassle, and defiantly doesn't turn out as well, but it is still possible.  Minnie had purchased a circular mirror prior to us being together at Home Interior for about $50 or $60 about 10 years now.  The gold color didn't quite match all of the black furniture in our bedroom.  I've had it on my list of projects to do, since we moved.  It's been happily sitting on the floor next to the bed for the last six months... and I finally got annoyed enough with it to say "this has to happen this weekend."</p>

<p>It was a pretty simple project, as most of my projects are.  It turned out alright, although I think it would have been better if I had done it during warmer months.  I was originally going to tape up the glass, and paint with it all intact, but it was much easier to unscrew everything and only paint the front shell.  I hung it from the tree, painted with a gloss spray paint and brought it inside to the basement to dry out of the extreme cold temperature.  There was a section that I sprayed over and sprayed over that seemed to keep running and not want to stick.  I figured a second coat would do the trick, so after 5 or 6 hours I took it back outside and tried it again.  I laid it on the ground this time, hopping to have less runs.  I again put it down in the basement.  After it dried for about a day, I found that there was still that spot which had continued to run.  In hind site, I should have sprayed it with some sort of base paint first, but I was just doing this with stuff I already had around the house.  I decided to take a sharpie and color over it, because the color would match.</p>

<p>Pretty simple, it didn't take much time, and now we have a mirror that matches the black furniture in the bedroom.  Check out the photo gallery below;</p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life has been busy lately, and I haven't posted anything for a while. Most of my time has been taken up by working. I'm working as a Mental Health Case Manager at Nueva Esperanza a part of <a href="http://www.tcc-health.org/" title="Tri-Cities Community Health">Tri-Cities Community Health</a>. I have been really loving it. I've gotten lots of cool opportunities working there, and am learning a lot.</p>

<p>I've still been working at <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org" title="Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery">Safe Harbor</a>. Next month, I will be starting to lead a group for pre-teens / teens. I'm pretty excited about it.</p>

<p>I also got to go to the social night out for <a href="http://www.youngprofessionalstc.org/" title="Young Professionals of the Tri-Cities">Young Professionals of the Tri-Cities</a>. It was nice to meet so many people of different organizations. I really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to have some changes come to my website here in the near future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Jacob The Not So Mad Scientist</title>

<p>As a mental health counselor, I feel that I have a pretty good grasp one how to raise my son, and what to do. Something I feel like I explain to parents frequently when they bring their kids in, especially young kids, is that the majority of the counseling I’m going to do is with them. I explain that they are with their children and have so much more powerful of an impact then I ever could in the hour a couple of times a month I get to see them.</p>

<p>I feel like with my education and experience, I have been able to discuss some pretty sound points with parents and work through some issues well. That being said, as I go into raising Mateo, it’s like everything is an experiment right now. Hopefully Mateo won’t feel too much like I’ve been experimenting on him when he gets older, but I figure we are in it together to find the best solutions to everything that comes up.</p>

<p>A couple of nights ago, Minnie and I were sitting eating dinner and Mateo was in his high chair (already having eaten). He kept throwing his little barn on the ground. I decided that I didn’t want to pick it up every couple of minutes. I know that he doesn’t have the fine motor control to really manipulate objects and move things around very well. He also get super excited and starts flailing his arms around (so cute). <strong>I am not saying that I was upset with him, or even view this as anything but normal baby behavior</strong>, that being said, I did say I’ve been experimenting on him (<em>not in any bad way</em>). I decided that every time he knocks his toys off his high chair, I will pick it up. I will show it to him and tell him that he supposed to keep it on the table (pointing to the table) and then put it on our table for him to look at for about a minute (I tell him that I will give it back to him after a minute). He’s a pretty content baby and doesn’t seem to mind losing his toy too much right now. After about a minute, I give the toy back to him and explain again that he can play with it, but not to throw it on the ground or he will lose it again for another minute.</p>

<p>All that being said, it’s a pretty simple exercise, and some classical conditioning. It does seem to be working some. While he still throws it on the ground or knocks it over, I feel like he is more careful with it now, as if he knows that he want’s to keep playing with it. Like I said, pretty simple little thing… but it does give me a bit of the mad scientist feeling of trying to figure out what works best. I just figured I’d share…</p>

<p>Also, today is Mateo’s Six Month Birthday! We completed our monthly photo shoot so I will be posted a lot of shots on <a href="http://instagram.com/campjacob">Instagram</a>, so make sure you check them out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Maybe I shouldn't feel too bad. Life has been hectic, and its been a long time since I've posted anything to here. My excuse is that it's because I purchased a home, no big deal right. It has been quite an experience and I'm a proud home owner now. I feel as if there are a million things that I've been thinking about posting on, but haven't. In this post I might overview some of them… But it is far too late tonight to go in depth with any topic.</p>

<p>I have been improving my Mac computing ability slowly and feel as if I know have a strong grip on the system and am absolutely loving it. Last thanksgiving I purchased a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>. It has been amazing. My mom just got a new Mac and I've been teaching her how to use it.</p>

<p>Staying on the Mac theme, I've been listening to the amazing Podcast <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/">Mac Power Users</a>. I've gone through almost a hundred of their sometimes 2 hour podcasts and I'm still not caught up. So much amazing information, it makes me feel like such the better nerd.</p>

<p>More than the looking for, negotiation (for sale by owner), and purchase of our home in Central Pasco… I've also been renovating some of it. I ripped out all of the living room carpet and refinished the hardwood floors. I've done some other projects to, some of which will likely end up in as <a href="/tags/diy">DIY</a> articles eventually.</p>

<p>I'm even doing a first ever complete post written from my iPad and is the first post I'm writing in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>. Maybe too many experiments at once, but I just really wanted to post something.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Dance Instructor Training</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/8/dance-instructor-training</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had aspirations of becoming a dance instructor for quite a while. During my Fall Quarter 2006 I had a friend who was taking a dance class at Eastern. I went with her and some other friends to the dance final and decided that I was hooked on dancing. The guy who teaches out at EWU also owns an excellent studio in Spokane (<a href="http://spokanedance.com/" title="Spokane Dance Company">Spokane Dance Company</a>). Since then I have taken ever dance class that I can, both at Eastern and at the studio. October 2007 I payed for and started participating in their Teacher Training Program. I took lots of classes and pasted a majority of my progress checks. between October and January. When classes started in the Winter my life got super hectic. I was working 30-40 hours a week at the CRC. I started doing my practicum that quarter too, working at the Juvenile about 30-60 hours a week. Furthermore I had a couple of classes I was taking. All in all, the studio took a second seat to everything I was doing.A couple of days ago, Glenn (the studio manager) asked me to meet with him. When I did, he told me that he had met with the studio’s board and they had decided that it was taking too long for me to make it though my progress checks. I was upset by this and relieved. It is nice to not feel guilty when I am unable to be at the studio. I also understand where they are coming from. I had used up all of the classes that I had payed for, and had been on a scholarship from the studio for a while. With just a few progress checks to go, I am no longer doing the instructor training program. I have no hurt feelings towards Glenn or the studio. I am grateful for the training that I have received and it was all a good experience. For all my friends at the studio, I hope to be able to come when I can. It might be a little while before I buy a new membership, because it’s been a while since I’ve had to have one. I don’t have any plans to purchase a new program from the studio anytime soon due to their costs and I paid for my teacher training in full already… which was fairly costly. But I hope to still see you all around.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Waiting is the Hardest Part</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/8/the-waiting-is-the-hardest-part</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems like a lot of parts of my life are just like the blackberry bush picture, not quite ripe yet. I feel like I have had a lot of different things in my life that I have lost recently. For example the dance instructor training, the depth of my spirituality (i.e. I haven't been going to church as much as I think I should), some relationships… etc. I feel like I've lost a lot recently. Other than having lost things, I'm also waiting for other things, especially my Europe trip, to know if I can do my practicum at the CRC, and just to see what my life is going to look like in the near future. I guess I have to agree with Tom Petty, and say that "The Waiting is the Hardest Part."</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/uMyCa35_mOg">The Waiting, by Tom Petty &amp; the Heart Breakers</a></p>

<p>It might seem like I need to send my computer away, because I have been spending too much time on it. Currently my eyes and head hurt a bit, due to the fact that I have been spending hours and hours working on my computer. Currently I just finished wrapping my computer to be sent to HP Support, and writing a paper. I have had computer issues for the last several weeks. My wireless adapter is not working, something that will be vital in Europe. I thought at first it was a software issues (or drivers)... but after doing a complete system restore, this option was shown as not viable. Then I replaced the wireless adapter completely, but again no effect. This final step will probably do another complete system restore and either replace or re-image my mother board. Either way, I am currently stuck with a loaner computer from school and crossing my fingers that my computer will get back before I leave on my trip.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>New Found Password</title>

<p>I seem to work many overnights at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yfaconnections.org/">Crisis Residential Center</a>. I think this might be due to the fact that I have a fairly hectic schedule and those are the hours that they can fit in with mine. I also think that many of the other support staff do not put the overnight shift on their availability as often as I do. I think that I might be a little bit crazy, but I’m really willing to work pretty much whenever right now. I think as my life changes, so will this priority… but thus far, I really don’t have a family to take care of. With these overnights, I have not been able to log onto the center’s wireless due to password. I finally thought about it (only 5 or 6 months later) and realized that I could get the password off of the staff office computer downstairs. Anyways, now I can actually work on my homework (though blackboard), my web design, or what ever else I need to do in my life. This comes not any too soon, because I work five overnights this week before I go to Europe.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Transition to SquareSpace &amp; Giant DYI Growth Chart Ruler</title>

<h2 id="changeinwebsite">Change in Website</h2>

<p>I figured that I would start off by saying that I'm not a professional web designer, although I have done it and graphic design on occasions professionally.  For the past couple of years I have been using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">CMS</a> called <a href="https://drupal.org">Drupal</a>.  There was a time when I was really enjoying learning some PHP and coding techniques.  As my life has gotten busier and now more family oriented... I haven't had as much time to keep updating it.</p>

<p>Many of the Podcasts that I like listening too, kept advertising SquareSpace.  It's has been pretty easy to set up and is fairly flexible.  I am missing how my site previously looked, and I still haven't been able to add all of my previous content in yet... so it is still a work in progress.  I still have my previous website running <a href="http://jacobrcampbell">http://jacobrcampbell.com/</a> and this post will even in the future likely be placed there, but for now I'm using <a href="http://jacob-campbell.squarespace.com">http://jacob-campbell.squarespace.com</a>.  I've decided that updating and keeping up the Drupal version of my website is too much work.  The last couple of months, I haven't even been able to log into my site.  I think there is some sort of problem with the tables, that i just don't have the expertise to fix.  I've been trying to find a programmer who is familiar with Drupal site development, and have been unable to.</p>

<p>I've decided that my primary purpose for having a website is to be able to write, especially here on my blog.  Maybe some day I will want to go back to something more like Drupal, but for the now the overhead is just too much (not to mention that I still can't log in and update my website currently...).  I've been spending some time transferring old articles and blog posts to my new site, but I decided that I do want to continue to post some new content even as I am going through this traditional phase.</p>

<h2 id="giantgrowthchart">Giant Growth Chart</h2>

<p>One thing that I have been wanting to post about for a while was a DYI project that I after moving into our new house.  I created a giant growth chart to be able to track Mateo's growth.  It was a pretty fun project.  I went to Lowes and bought a 12' by 8" board.  I sanded it down (60, 80, 120 grits) and stained it to match our hard wood floors.  After attaching it to the wall, we have been attaching photos of Mateo as he has been getting taller.  I had decided that I wanted to do it with pictures and I thought about a lot of different ways to attach pictures.  The following is what I did.</p>

<p>I bought a bunch of metal refrigerator magnets.  I removed the magnet part along with the casing for it.  I screwed in at the height that Mateo was when the photo was taken the clip to the wood.  We took a bunch of pictures and posted the best ones to <a href="http://instagram.com/campjacb">Instagram</a> with information about the date, and age of Mateo.  I printed them for 36 cents at Walgreens through their iPhone app and picked them up. I think it's been turing out pretty great.  I figured that Minnie and I had to be on the chart too... even though we won't be growing any more.</p>

<p>Check out my gallery of photos from the growth chart project. </p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390018418104_14160">Since leaving Europe this summer, I have been wanting to to travel again. I signed up for this class, International Social Work, that would give me just such an opportunity. It's traveling over spring break to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima" data-cke-saved-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima" target="_blank">Lima Peru</a> to work in an Orphanage. The Orphanage is Puericultorio Perez Aranibar (PPA). It is for 10 days, and should be an amazing experience. We met at the airport about 03:45 am in Spokane on the 20th. Meeting so early for a flight meant that I didn't sleep. Four airports, 16 hours of flight time, and a grand total of almost 24 hours of travel time we finally made it to Peru.</p>

You can read about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.globalvolunteers.org/peru/">Global Volunteers in Peru</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p><p>We arrived in Peru and finally got to the hostel at about 12:30. Me and a couple of the other's decided that we wanted to go to the beach for a bit, and maybe have a drink. We took a Taxi to LaComer, an upscale "mall." It was beautiful to just relax and sit outside. Long travel days always mean the need to take a break. The next morning, 9am we were meeting to to to the PPA for the first time. We got an in-depth tour of the PPA. It was a hard revolution to know that the PPA takes care of at least 450 children from all over Lima. These kids come from all different ages (several months till 18). Some are orphans, and don't have anywhere else to go. The others, their parents aren't able to take care of them, so they come to the PPA. It was hard to walk into this giant room for the toddlers and hear a couple of them just screaming. Edith, our local team leader told us that the child just come in a couple of days ago. Many of the workers don't always have time to give individual care to each of the children, only to take care of them. That is hopefully what we are here to accomplish.</p><p>Abusto E. Perez Aranibar, the creator of the PPA once said that he was hoping to create a Palace for the Children. The PPA has such a great vision and inspires a lot of hope. Regardless of the hope, it is still hard to see the lives these children live.</p><p>After touring the PPA, we went with LimaVision on a tour of the City. We saw centuries old ruins, beautiful houses in the wealthier district, olive trees, the Cathedral of Lima, Catacombs (and lots of bones), Plazza Mayor, and many other areas. The tour was great to get a quick view all around Lima, although it was the most touristy areas and not exactly the real Lima.</p><p>After dinning on meat and cheese filled empanadas and pizza, singing happy 21st birthday to Emily for the third time (plus getting her second dessert), some of the group decided they wanted to hit the town. We were first directed to this bar, with almost no name on the top and on the second story. It was a pretty cool place to chill out for a bit (well, actually it was really hot with no air flow), but the group decided that they wanted to go and dance. We wound though the maze of the bar (they put us back in our own room and played English music… not sure how I feel about that yet) and set out to find a club were people where dancing. The first one we found, was ok. It was kind of small, and they played mostly reggaeton. Right before we left, they had some African Drummers come out and preform… having the different guy's and girls get up and dance. One of the girls (well, older ladies) pulled Gabe up and had him dance with her. It was hilarious. We went to one other place. This place had people both dancing to reggaeton and to Salsa. It was a lot of fun, and we didn't leave until after 2am. Went back to the hostel and ended up just sitting outside for almost an hour just talking to Kellie. Before going to bed, spent some time sitting and reading / praying / thinking sitting overlooking some of the noisy Lima streets.</p><p>I am really looking forward to spending time at the orphanage tomorrow, I really can't wait. I hope I can at least just make one of the kids smile and feel loved and accepted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390018418104_39127">Sunday was a free day, which for me, meant sleeping in until late. I woke up and wondered down to the nearest café to order a chorizo enchilada and an Inca Cola for breakfast (maybe lunch). I spent some time on the internet at the local internet café and back to the hostel to just relax and get ready to head out to dinner. I spent some time reading down by the river and watching the sunset. Peruvians seem to flock to the streets and parks to hang out and spend time with each other (check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.514407022486.2033848.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=c5b97ed2a6" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.514407022486.2033848.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=c5b97ed2a6" target="_blank">Peru~ Dias Tres y Cuatro Facebook Album</a>.</p>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390018418104_39130">I really enjoy just hanging out with people. I don't feel like, for me to be happy, I necessarily have to be doing something. I truly just love to spend time with people, maybe talk, maybe sit somewhere cool. I don't feel like this is always acceptable. I end up not just dropping by or calling friends just because I do not have something in particular to do. I feel like Peruvians do not suffer from this. It seems like they are just happy to go to the park (by the ocean side) and watch the sunset together. Nothing that has to be done, just spending time. I really love that, and wish I had the courage to do live the same.<br></p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390018418104_39213"><br>After watching the sun set, eating dinner we participated in some team building activities and I spent some time reading. The last couple of days I have been reading the first couple of chapters of Proverbs. I have also been reading Einstein: His World and Universe. I was amazed at Proverbs and the number of times, speaking about wisdom, that “she” is out in the streets or at the gates… etc basically that we ought to be looking in our common lives for wisdom. Also, in the Einstein book I have been amazed at the number of his and other's “scientific revelations” came about as they were doing common daily activities (working, at a stop light... etc).</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390018418104_39216">Today was the first Day at the PPA. It was a amazing experience. We meet with various area leaders, introducing ourselves in Spanish. Three other volunteers and I spent our morning working in the jardin (garden). The afternoon was filled with attempting to teach eight year olds English. This cause was difficult and quickly dissolved into playing futból outside. I was also quickly surrounded by youth wanting me to pick all of them up at the same time and spin them around. It's hard to know that you can not be there for all 16 boys we were working with.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390018418104_39288">Tomorrow should be some more of the same... yet different.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At work recently, I have been thinking about some tough issues. Weighing the balance of the good for the many verses the good for the one is something that seems to come up over and over in residential work. Often at the CRC, our last effort to curb negative behavior of a youth is to "punish" the group. This often means taking away the T.V. or not being able to go on an outing, because one youth is acting out negatively. This is always a tough decision, because it is hard to punish the many because of the behavior of the one.</p><p>An even more difficult weight that sometimes must be balanced is in looking towards a youth that really needs a lot of help, support, and love. These youth that need more time spent working with them, sometimes take staff's time away from the other youth. One particular youth often required one to one staffing (something that was unthinkable from my times at Jubilee). While it is great to pour that much attention into one youth, sometimes I feel like I haven't had time to come and give to the other youth at the facility. This youth has also displayed behavior that could be harmful to the other clients (bullying and threatening).</p><p>It can be very tough to know that one person really has a lot of need, and wanting to help them as much as possible. But to at the same time, understand that there is a need to help as many as possible. Maybe even be able to focus more on youth who are receptive and willing to work on issue. I guess it can be broken down into two ethical fields of thoughts. That of utilitarianism and of Kantian ethics. I believe it is much too early in the morning to spend time getting into the specifics of the arguments.</p><p>What do you guy's believe is the best way to judge if one ought to work with the one at the expense of the many or the many at the expense of the one?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In my years working with at-risk youth, I've come to have some pretty crazy stories that I was either there for or heard about second hand. Yesterday, was no exception. What I can say is that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2009/jun/17/one-arrested-machete-attack/">a man with a machete attacked a teenager</a>&nbsp;outside of my work yesterday. Apparently after the attack he walked calmly up to the Crisis Residential Center, and was attempting to get in. The Spokesman Review article describes the attacker as a possible mental patient.</p><p>While I wasn't at work during this incident, It's pretty crazy and tops any other stories I've head before. It has also made me think about violence that is taking part with our youth. While the attacker was 49 years old, it was still an attack on a teenager. Maybe it's that I've been watching too much <a target="_blank" href="http://www.history.com/content/gangland">GangLand</a> on the history channel (you used to be able to watch videos on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ninjavideo.net/">NinjaVideo.net</a>), but I think that all of the violence is crazy. In thinking about violence, I think that it is about building up our communities. Although Spokane is not a huge place, it is growing. There is a gang problem, I realized that while working at Spokane Juvenile Detention. There are some pretty bad neighborhoods, check out the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spokanegis.org/crimemap2/">Crimemap</a>. I believe it is about staying in some of these more needy neighborhoods. It's going to be the community to help change the violence. A good book about inner city violence is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fist-Stick-Knife-Gun-Personal/dp/0807004235"><em>Fist Stick Knife Gun</em>&nbsp;by Geoffrey Canada</a>.</p><p>The other crazy thing that is happening right now, is that I just bought tickets to go to South America. We fly into Trinidad and Tobago into Port of Spain. Me and Ami are still attempting to lock down some ideas about exactly what we will be doing, but it is now a for sure thing (tickets purchased).</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318462/" title="IMDB Link">The Motorcycle Diaries (2004)</a> is about two men from Buenos Aires who make plans to travel by motorcycle travel around the coast of South America. The story comes from journey and written memoir of the 23-year-old Ernesto ("Che") Guevara. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara" title="Che Guevara article on Wikipedia">Che Guevara</a> years later become internationally known as the iconic Marxist revolutionary. The film recounts the 1952 journey, initially by motorcycle, across South America by Guevara and his friend Alberto Granado. As the adventure centered around youthful hedonism unfolds, Guevara discovers himself transformed by his observations of the life of the impoverished indigenous peasantry. The road presents Ernesto Guevara and Alberto Granado a genuine picture of the Latin American identity. Through the characters they encounter on the road, Guevara and Granado learn the injustices the impoverished face and are exposed to people they would have never encountered in their hometown. The trip serves to expose a Latin American identity as well as explore the identity of one of its most memorable revolutionaries. This description changed from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motorcycle_Diaries_(film)" title="wikipedia Article on the film">Wikipedia entry</a></p>

<p>I watched this movie last night with my friend who I am going to be traveling around South America with. It was a powerful movie, and one that I highly recommend for anybody to watch. Watching it, made me think about my upcoming trip, and what some of my expectations/reasons for going are. The following is some of what these are</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learn Spanish</strong>: When I was in <a href="/blog?tag=Barcelona%20Spain">Barcelona Spain</a> during my <a href="/blog/european-excursion-2008">European Excursion</a>, it was the place linguistically I felt the most comfortable. I want to be able to come back fluent, especially able to counsel and work with people I might other wise have had a language barrier.</li>
<li><strong>Meet/See/Do</strong>: I've been very fortunate in my life to travel and see lots of the world. Already in my life I've been to four of the six continents I want to see (I have no desire to go to Antarctica). I love the feeling of being on the road. During my travels I've gotten to meet so many different people, that have improved and influenced my life. As I've gone places, the people have opened up my heart and encouraged me. I've also seen some of the most beautiful sights all around the world. I love seeing new places, and learning about the history and culture.</li>
<li><em>*Sort of a Sabbatical *</em>: Sense graduating from High School, I have been working on preparing myself for my career for the last seven years. I spent two years involved in a leadership training/discipleship program called the <a href="http://masterscommission.com/" title="The Master's Commission">Master's Commission</a>. After that I went to <a href="http://www.columbiabasin.edu/home/index.asp" title="Columbia Basin Community College">community college</a> and earned my AA, transferred to <a href="http://www.ewu.edu/Home.xml" title="Eastern Washington Univeristy">Eastern Washington University</a> and first earned my BA in Social Work and now most recently my master's degree in social work. I think it is fitting to spend a year traveling and refocusing for my return and beginning of my career.</li>
<li><strong>Finding Direction</strong>: I don't feel like I'm running away scared from my future, but I don't know really what the next step is for me. I think the traditional concept for after graduation is to start "real life." I don't like the idea of this. I feel like we should live/love the moments we are at in life. We don't have any time other than the now. I don't feel ready for things like getting a career job, buying a house, getting married, having a dog… etc. OK, dog thing sounds good, but I'm just not ready for the rest.</li>
<li><strong>Letting The World Change Me</strong>: Just like in the movie the Motorcycle Diaries, I am hoping that the experience will change me and prepare me to go out and change the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that is quite a list of different hopes for my trip. If you want to see <a href="http://youtu.be/7u0U3dbVMHk">a preview of the move Motorcycle Diaries watch it from youtube</a> below.</p>

      <title>Quick Update From Isla de Margarita</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/9/quick-update-from-isla-de-margarita</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While traveling sometimes, it seems like I might spend too much time on my computer. Especially because I am a bit of a perfectionist, I take quite a bit of time to get any one thing finished. I was hoping to write about some of my experiences over the last week… but it's just taken way too long to get everything done (so hopefully tomorrow). It's already almost 11pm here in Venezuela, and I have a 6am boating excursion in the morning. I did figure that I would leave you with a couple of things. I'm making a list of all my posts, and other facts (including my Google Maps trip viewer) at a page on my blog (<a href="/blog/?tag=Jaunt+Down+South+2010">Jaunt Down South</a>). I have uploaded my pictures so far from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.525130557436.2042615.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=5e45ac3c55" title="Venezuela, Entering a Whole New World Facebook Album">Venezuela, Entering a Whole New World Facebook Album</a>. I have also updated places that we have been on my Google Maps:</p>

<h2>What is Our Relationship to the Poor and Needy</h2><p>Traveling through South America there are a lot of opportunities to see different governments, social service institutions, churches, and poverty. But what is the churches/government's responsibility to these people. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ps%2082&amp;version=NASB">Psalm 82</a>&nbsp;seems to address just this and share some of God's heart to the poor and needy.</p><figure >
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>God takes His stand in His own congregation; He judges in the midst of the rulers. How long will you judge unjustly And show partiality to the wicked? Selah.<br/><br/>Vindicate the weak and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and destitute. Rescue the weak and needy; Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked. They do not know nor do they understand; They walk about in darkness; All the foundations of the earth are shaken. I said, “You are gods, And all of you are sons of the Most High. “Nevertheless you will die like men And fall like any one of the princes.” Arise, O God, judge the earth! For it is You who possesses all the nations.<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption class="source">&mdash; Psalm 82:1-8</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I find this Psalm particularly interesting. I was reading it while I was in Trinidad at the Hotel. I think it was really interesting to read before we made it to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, a mostly socialist nation. While it seems to have corruption, and a lot of it's own issues… it is interesting to see how they care for their people.</p><p>Particularly with this Psalm, I find it interesting that it describes God both judging the church and the rulers (v. 1). It talks about about God judging them based on three tasks (vs. 3-4).</p><ol><li>How they vindicate the weak and fatherless</li><li>Do justice to the afflicted and destitute</li><li>Rescue the weak and needy and deliver them out of the hand of the wicked</li></ol><p>In the Christian circles I travel in, it seems well known that it is the churches/individuals responsibility to take care of those in need. Within those circles, I don't hear very much about that same responsibility being on the government/officials. If I was to describe my political viewpoint, it can sometimes be difficult to describe.</p><p>I would describe myself as pragmatically very liberal, but idealistically conservative. This means that in an ideal world all of the poor, needy, destitute, fatherless would be cared for in the private sector. I believe the private sector is much efficient and people friendly. Having worked within some of the bureaucracy in Washington State (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dshs.wa.gov/">DSHS</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dshs.wa.gov/jra/">JRA</a>) I have found the pubic agencies to be difficult to find services for people, sometimes have more burnt-out people working there, and they are not efficient. It seems very different in the private sector. This is especially true in regards to if it's a church/individual. The problem I see, and the reason that I would say pragmatically I'm very liberal is that I don't see the private sector as having the funds, and the churches/individuals are not stepping up enough. In my introduction to Social Work Class, my professor described that the yearly budget for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.liveunited.org/">United Way</a> (a giant international agency) is the same as the daily budget for DSHS. It seems that while the private sector is a more idealistic way to go, that the finances are not there.</p><p>When Ps 82 describes that the government officials are responsible for how they have done justice to the people, I think that we ought to listen. While there are many needs and problems in a country like Venezuela, at least they have a health care system that looks after all of their people. Something that I hope happens soon in the United States. I just pray that our politicians will get a measure of the fear of God and understand that they will be judged according to how they work for the people they govern.</p><h2>The last little bit of Trinidad &amp; Tobago</h2>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_64422">Again, you can see all the photo's from Trinidad &amp; Tobago on their album on Facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.524870059476.2042340.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=aeab88d4ed" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.524870059476.2042340.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=aeab88d4ed" target="_blank">Miami Heat in the Evening and Trinidad CoExisting Island Style Facebook Album</a>). We ended up spending a total of five days in both Trinidad &amp; Tobago. It was really interesting to go and walk around Lapeyrouse Cemetery in Port of Spain. We saw a couple of homeless people. One of which was a bit scary because he was walking around with a lead pipe. We met a father and son (at least that was our guess) who were staying in a tomb in in the cemetery. The father talked to us for a while, and it was really interesting to hear his perspective. We ended up giving him some TT (the money used in Trinidad &amp; Tobago). I was struck thinking that I couldn't imagine living inside of a tomb. By the third day in Port of Spain, we were ready to head out and find a beach somewhere. The only problem is that they are not easy to get to in Trinidad (at least there were non in Port of Spain, you have to go to another part of the country). We had heard really great things about Tobago, so we decided to adventure out to there.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_64425">There are ferries that run multiple times per day to Trinidad. We landed in The Port of Scarborough. We ended up staying at a guest house with a lady named Phyllis. It was beautiful to sit on the porch and talk with her about life/politics. The next day we went to the Beach at Store Bay. There is a beautiful beach there, and we got to meet some travelers from England there. We did not stay in Tobago for very long, and we had to catch a ferry to Venezuela early the next morning.<br></p><h2 id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_67302">Venezuela: Guardia Nacional, Fellow Travelers, and Beaches/Yachts</h2>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_68382">We originally flew into Trinidad, because it had the cheapest flights. We figured that it would be really simple to get to the mainland and head to Venezuela. This was not the case. We found one ferry that travels to Guiria once a week. Trinidad is significantly more expensive and less friendly then Venezuela so we were really glad to finally make it to the mainland. On the Ferry we ended up meeting about 10 other European travelers (from England, Germany, and Austria). This was a very beautiful thing. It is really strange to get into a new country, be unsure of the money, not know where you are, have issues with the language… etc. Traveling in a group is a great thing. We had gotten to Guiria too late to catch a bus to Cumana. We had to exchange some US dollars on the "black market" and catch a taxi to Carupano. Venezuela's exchange rate is about 2 Venezuelan bolivar fortes to 1 USD. But if you exchange on the "black market" it's about 5-7. The best we've found has been 6.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_68385">Before leaving Guiria, our taxis were stopped by the Guardia Nacional (the national police… or these guy's with large guns speaking to you in Spanish). We all had to empty our bags/pockets. They wanted to know how much money we had, and even made us count it out for them (I think due to black market). About an hour taxi ride later we were stopped again, and had to do the same. Every other Guardia Nacional stop after that, we clapped for the taxi driver because we didn't have to stop. I was worried about some sort of "imposed tax" but there was nothing like that. An almost 3.5 hour taxi drive later we ended up in Carupano (it only cost the equivalent of $6 each person… amazingly cheap). We grabbed some empanadas, and caught a bus to Cumana. We arrived pretty late in Cumana and stayed at a place called the Hotel Astoria. The next morning we did some exploring, and six of us took a ferry to Margarita Island.</p>

<p>The first night we stayed in a city in Polamar (Hotel Centro… basic accommodations but under $10 per night). The next morning we found out that the governor of Isla de Margarita had called an holiday the day before. We watched Hugo Chavez talk about Bush trying to assassinate him on Larry King Live only to find out that he (and other Latin/African national leaders) were having a summit on Isla de Margarita. With everything closed we made our way to Juan Griego to stay at <a target="_blank" href="http://hotelpatrick.com/">Hotel Patrick</a>. While we didn't realize this, Chavez was to have the summit right outside of the city. We arrived disoriented with two other English travelers in Juan Griego to a crowd gathering to hopefully get to see the loved presidente (apparently not everybody is happy with him, but this city is a part of his political base). We've found Hotel Patrick to be the best we've stayed in (and for me better than anywhere in Europe). While we've been here, we have spent our days at the beach. Playa Caribe is a wonderful beach. We also chartered a 30 ft yacht ($50 per person) who took us to this beautiful little island and we snorkeled/scuba dived (amazing fish and a little bit of reef), got to learn to sail a little bit. It has been truly the vacation part of our trip. Tomorrow we are meeting up with our friends from Austria and celebrating Ami's second birthday (she will get two parties… lucky).</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Yacht Trips, All Inclusive Hotels, Two Day Birthday Celebrations, and Leaving</h2>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1536.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/52db5e6be4b0d4a368290889/1390108272372/sunset-isla-de-margarita-off-yacht.JPG" alt=" Sunset Off the Yacht    "/>  Sunset Off the Yacht    [/caption] 
  

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_93880">As I briefly described in the last post, we got the opportunity to go on a small yacht. This was a pretty phenomenal opportunity. It also meant that Ami got to celebrate her birthday on two separate days (something that I don't think I will get in return). A guy named Gorden (originally from Great Britain, and having retired on his yacht for the last 15 years) took us out. Michael (the hotel owner) and two travelers from England (Son &amp; Ella) all went out. I decided that I'm not a sailor by nature (so maybe I'll have to practice and I'll get there). While I didn't puke, I did get very noxious both going and coming from Islas Los Frailes (about a 4 hour sailing trip there, and 2.5 hours coming back). When we got there, I burnt my back getting lost snorkeling. There were bits of coral, amazing tropical fish, and beautiful countryside/water. After I and especially Ami were thoroughly burned we got the opportunity to play with some scuba gear for a short period of time. It reminded me of my days wanting to be an underwater photographer and wanting to become certified to dive. We ate some chips and corned beef to sail with the wind at our backs and the sun setting beautifully over the oceans expanse. When I tried to sail, I got the boat to spin to donuts (on purpose, I swear). Gordon gave us some jungle homemade wine, told us sailing stories (both about women and the sea), and felt the cool ocean breeze. When we got back, I went and bought Ami a Tarta (A kind of cake). They turned the lights down low, everybody at Hotel Patrick sang happy birthday to Ami and her extinguishing candle.</p>

<p>The next morning, we made our way to La Asunción, the capital of the provincia that we are in. It's a quaint Spanish colonial town. We got to see the museum, the oldest church in Isla de Margarita, and some neat art work. We also got lost looking for our next bus and ended up getting picked up by some nice locals (kind of hitch hiking…). We went to Playa Agua, a very long beach that is on par with the same in California. Although we didn't make it to the beach. We went to Palm Beach Hotel and met up with some fellow travelers we met on the ferry, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/profile.html?id=8Q6H885">Daniel and Bine</a>. They are an awesome Austrian couple where were ending their trip. They had an all inclusive stay and ended up continuously brining us drinks for Ami's birthday (number 2). After that, we made our way back to Hotel Patrick for a fresh fish dinner. It was so amazing with potatoes and onions. We hung out with everybody, talking, dancing, playing some games… a pretty great night.</p><p>Today we relaxed, finalized some of our plans (we are heading to Ciudad Bolívar Venezuela and then to Manaus Brazil). We went to Polamar to get our ferry tickets, hung out and looked at the local shopping, drank tea, and came back to Hotel Patrick. We had to say good bye to everybody because we are leaving early in the morning (speaking of which I ought to head to sleep here in a couple of minutes. We will both miss being here at Isla de Margarita and the Caribbean.</p><h2>Long Bus Rides and Jungle Cities</h2><p>I'll apologize straight off, I wrote the majority of this post several days ago, but we have mostly been without internet. Currently I'm in Santa Elena Venezuela. It's interesting that we are in an area called el fronteira (the frontier). It's not a tiny town, but it is small and in the jungle. It's also very beautiful.</p><p>After leaving Margarita Island, we took a ferry which landed us in Porta La Cruz. We were immediately able to catch a bus heading down to Ciudad Bolivar. We spent the night at a place called The Ritz (a very sarcastic name). It was a fun place to stay. We met a missionary there named Raul and had some pretty awesome broken conversations. The next day we went to the botanical gardens (but mainly walked around the park. As it started to get dark, we decided that it was time to try to get our bus down to Santa Elena de Uairen. It was a 10 to 12 hour bus ride… but I at least got some sleep.</p><p>We are staying right now in the Hotel Michelle. It's a pretty nice. We went out last night to try to go dancing… but there weren't as many people as we would expect on a Friday night. Today we spent time thinking about going to some waterfalls, but had trouble finding the bus that headed that direction. All and all it's been pretty amazing. We are hoping that we can get our visas on Monday and head into Brazil. Hopefully when we get to Manaus there will be wifi and I can upload pictures and spend more time updating everybody.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_116991">Now that I have more time, I will go a little more in-depth regarding the last week or so. We sadly left Isla de Margarita. It was a really great place. Ami said a number of times that she could imagine just taking a short trip there and spending a couple of weeks sometime later. We took a ferry to Port of Cruz. The ferry ride took about two hours. The ferry was very nice and smooth ride (a nice change from the small sailing yacht we were on before). I guess there was some sort of wildlife out the window, but both Ami and I missed it. All I know is I was listening to some <a href="http://www.daddyyankee.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.daddyyankee.com/" target="_blank">Daddy Yankee</a> on my iPod and then there was a commotion and everybody was standing next to the window. When I tried asking in broken Spanish what they saw, I believe they told me it was dolphins.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_116994">When we got to Puerto La Cruz we took a taxi to the bus terminal. Our broken Spanish made us think we had to wait around the bus station until the early morning. We came to find out that we were catching the bus that was leaving in a half hour.<br></p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_117000">It was a 10 hour bus ride to get to Ciudad Bolívar. We stayed at a place called Hotel Ritz. It's really a kind of funny name, because it is probably the dingiest accommodations that we have stayed at so far (and that's saying a little bit). We got there and finally found a bus heading the right direction and it was starting to get dark. We were greeted by a couple of Missionaries (I mentioned them before). They were a bit older and they told us that it is unsafe to go out after 6pm. Through hand motions and similar words in both English/Spanish we figured out that he was worried we might get robbed or shot. We were tired anyways from the bus ride earlier and decided to stay in. Later that night we ate a meal at the Hotel, talked with the missionaries for a while and just went to sleep. While I was standing outside our room, I could have sworn that I saw a lemur or something similar. But after getting my flashlight the only animal that I could find in the nearby tree was a cat (I'm not saying there wasn't a lemur though).</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_117003">The next day, after a breakfast of fruit and empanadas we wondered down to the Jardín Botánico Del Orinoco. It was a really pretty park. A lot of it was under construction. At the far end, it looked like they were getting ready to plant a bunch of parts of a type of display garden. There was also a giant fish tank that didn't have anything in it. We did see an iguana in the trees and try to sneak into the payed part of the garden during everybody's lunch break (we didn't realize that you had to pay for a guide). After spending time at the park, finding lunch, and relaxing at the Hotel Ritz… we went to wait at airport (where we were too catch our bus). About then it started storming. It was the first real rain storm that we've gotten while we've been here. Which I find to be really odd, due to the fact that it's supposed to be the rainy season. The power went out at the airport several times, the wind tried to blow the glass doors off the hinges, rain came down sideways and tried to flood the doorway. It was a pretty amazing storm.</p><h2 id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_120915">Hanging out in Santa Elena de Uairén Waiting for Brazilian Visas</h2><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_117009">It was another 10 hour overnight bus ride to get to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Elena_de_Uair%C3%A9n" data-cke-saved-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Elena_de_Uair%C3%A9n" target="_blank">Santa Elena de Uairén</a>. I find it nice to arrive in a city in the early morning. It's much better than trying to figure things out late at night. The problem is that you never really sleep on the night bus (especially when it's deathly cold as the buses are in Venezuela). Shivering we left to find <a href="http://hotels.lonelyplanet.com/venezuela/santa-elena-de-uairen-r2103569/posada-michelle-p1057698/" data-cke-saved-href="http://hotels.lonelyplanet.com/venezuela/santa-elena-de-uairen-r2103569/posada-michelle-p1057698/" target="_blank">Hotel Michelle</a>. Both Ami and I passed out for a couple of hours before we set off to try to find food/visas… and trouble.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_117012">One thing that you must understand about Venezuela is that it is a very cash oriented society. Almost nowhere accepts visa (really the commercials lie… it's not good everywhere). The places that do accept visa it's a bad idea to use it. Currently the exchange rate for the bolívar fuerte is about <a href="http://coinmill.com/VEF_calculator.html" data-cke-saved-href="http://coinmill.com/VEF_calculator.html" target="_blank">2 to 1 USD</a>. If you get this as the exchange rate Venezuela quickly becomes a very expensive country. The best thing to do is to go to the "black market" and exchange your money. There we got 5 to 7 for each USD. This expands your money well over a hundred percent. The "black market" is not as dodgy (to use a great term from the UK) as one might think. Usually in a town there are areas that many men stand around with calculators and fanny packs full of money. They just ask everyone if they want to cambio dollars. And you settle on a rate. I've seen the Guardia National watching them obviously. I guess there is some risk (somebody knowing how much cash you have, or taking your stack and running… etc). But it really isn't bad. The problem comes when you don't account for this before you get into Venezuela. This was our problem almost the whole time we were in Venezuela. When we were on Isla de Margarita our hotel owner had a friend who preformed a bank transfer getting us about a four to one rate. We figured the amounts that we would need to make it to Brazil… but fell short of the four nights that we ended up staying in Santa Elena de Uairén. We ended up paying for night at our hostel and using the last of our bolivars.<br></p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_117018">We woke up and went to find food (I'm happier and think better when I have something in my belly), hoping to just get the bad exchange rate though our debit cards. But it was nearly impossible (there is one in the city) to find a restaurant that excepted Visa. The two banks in town would not let us withdraw money from an international card either so that was not an option. After obtaining food, we found our way to the Brazilian Consulate who told us that we had to pay in bolivars to obtain our visa and that they did not want to start the process on a Friday (due to the fact that they would have to keep our passports over the weekend).<br></p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_117024">We ended up convincing a taxi driver to take us to La Linea (the town on the border of Brazil and Venezuela) to use the international ATM. At first the ATM wouldn't accept our cards and we ended up enlisting the help of an an off duty police officer (the National Brazilian Police ended up calling him). Finally we got cash and went back to the Hotel. That night we decided we had some money, and we would go to the local Discotech. It turns out that not many people go out in Santa Elena de Uairén. But we danced at the local bar and the Discotech and had a really fun night. The next day we just kind of hummed around town with thoughts of trying to rent a car to get to some waterfalls (we were going to take a bus… but we couldn't figure it out).</p>

The next day we ended up tagging along with some people from Poland to go on a short jungle trek. We went to go and see Salto Agua Fria (Cold Water Waterfall). It really wasn't that cold, but was really amazing. On our trek we didn't see a ton of wildlife (birds, insects, reptiles) but we did see some amazing views. We had to walk about an hour down this steep hill, wonder into the jungle crossing this river on stones several times. The first waterfall was pretty small, but when I first saw it I was really excited. We trekked up and down pulling ourselves up by the plentiful vines some more and finally made it to Salto Agua Fria. Most of the group of us who went, stripped down and jumped in the little pool that formed just below the waterfall. Sitting under the waterfall it was a little hard to breath with the pressure of the water falling from so high. Our guide lent us his socks to climb and jump off some rocks (a good second free fall). After getting out of the beautiful fresh water we started trekking again. We swung on some Tarzan vines and ended up the the second larger waterfall. This one was significantly lower than Salto Agua Fria, but had it's own challenge. In Spanish our guide tells us to put everything in a garbage bag and strip down. We comply and he explains that we are going to climb straight up the waterfall. It was a really amazing experience.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_123128">After getting to the top of the water fall we left our stuff on some rocks and forded the river barefoot. We could hear water and assumed that we were coming upon another waterfall. Our guide told us to close our eyes and he hand led us through the river for a while. When he told us to open our eyes, we were staring at Salto Puerta del Cielo (The Door to the Heavens Waterfall). It was magnificent. We climbed up more and were able to get right under it. The entire waterfall ran over this jade rock.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_123131">It took us a long time to hike back up to the top. When we got to the top our guide asked if we wanted to hard or easy second part of the trek. We decided even though we were still out of breath, that we would take the hard way. We ended up driving a little ways and climbing down into the jungle at the top of Salto Puerta del Cielo. As we climbed down we came upon about 30 people just hanging out (swimming, BBQing, talking… etc). I feel like that is where I would be if I lived in Santa Elena. We wondered down the river, and found the edge of Salto Puerta del Cielo. It was really glorious to come to the top of the waterfall and be able to look out at at the expansive jungle.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_123134">After trekking back to the car and making it back to Santa Elena we were both pretty exhausted. We figured it would be a good day to sit and watch a movie. The first movie I bought the store owner said that it was in English… but we quickly found out that none of the six movies were in English (burned disk with 6 different movies). I was sad, because the movie I had wanted to watch was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328107/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328107/" target="_blank">Man on Fire</a>, a movie about abduction in Latin America. We went out for a second try and found a really nice and excited store owner. He showed us which movies were in English and which weren't. He even let us preview them. We ended up watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821642/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821642/" target="_blank">The Soloist</a>, a really great movie I'd recommend.</p>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_123137">The next day was Monday, and the Brazilian Consulate was finally going to be open. We went and paid for our visas. We spent the day going to La Línea to pull out more Brazilian Reais with the idea that we would exchange them on the black market (maybe once or twice) and hopefully make some sort of profit. When we got to the ATM, both of our cards were denied. Almost two hours of phone calls later, and some lunch later we got our debit cards unblocked (they got blocked because we didn't notify our banks prior to traveling). We decided to just pull out some and exchange it. The problem is since we've been in Brazil nobody seems to want to exchange our Bolivars (and give us about a 150% profit).<br></p><p>When we finally got back I went and got my hair cut. It's really complicated to explain to somebody how to cut your hair. I tried to tell the lady how much I wanted cut off. I think that she just wanted to cut my hair how she thought it should be done. I came out of the salon feeling much lighter and with very little hair.</p><p>The Next day we went back to La Línea and caught a taxi for about 2.5 hours and $15 USD. Then we took a 12 hour bus ride to Manaus. We arrived early in the morning having met new fellow travelers. We caught a taxi to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hostelmanaus.com/">Hostel Manaus</a>. While we've been in Manaus we have done some pretty cool things. We went to a wildlife preserve, A giant discotek, got an English tour of Teatro Amazonas (the Amazonian Opera House), and just wondering around. It's been really fun so far. Pictures coming soon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It seems that I am always weighting the balance between action and contemplation. While I am traveling it seems easier to focus on the action, and lose the contemplation all together. That is not to say that while I have been gone, I have done no thinking about things (this is very far from the truth). It is more that I have done limited amounts of compiling stories, photos, and maps of my journey to be published online.<br></p><h2 id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_150341">Wondering Around Manaus</h2>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_152776">We spent a little over a week in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaus" data-cke-saved-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manaus" target="_blank">Manaus</a>. Manaus seems to be the Jungle capital of Brazil (and maybe South America). There were hundreds of tour operators, all with different plans and levels of services. We could not walk out of Hostel Manaus (where we stayed) without a nearby tour agency asking us if we needed a jungle tour. Our Hostel also provided jungle tours that could be utilized too.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_152782">The plan was to head to Bolivia to do a jungle tour there (Bolivia is supposed to have more wildlife and be much cheaper). Other than Jungle tours there are many things to do in Manaus. We spent an afternoon touring the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Theatre" data-cke-saved-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Theatre" target="_blank">Teatro Amazonas</a>&nbsp;(Opera House). A grand theater that was built during the rubber boom of the late 1800's. It is comprised of materials brought from Europe and entirely decorated by European artists. After checking out the Opera House, we walked across the street and Ami got to see her first Orchids on an actual tree. She went a bit photo crazy and was so happy.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_152785">We found other orchids at this Parque Senador Jéfferson Péres. It is a beautiful new park (still partially under construction. It has little outlets of the Rio Negra flowing out to the city in it. They had a building that was supposed to contain different species of orchids. The building was locked the three different ventures that Ami tried to go. The first day we went, was a neat experience.<br></p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="2500.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/52db68b5e4b045b93302455e/1432258940776/manaus-inlet-rio-negra-poverty.JPG" alt="  Young girls sitting in trash in an inlet of the Rio Negra  "/>   Young girls sitting in trash in an inlet of the Rio Negra  [/caption] 
  

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_158384">After wondering around the parque for a while, we ended up coming out to a larger inlet of the Rio Negra. While we were there, it was the very beginning of the rainy season (mostly it had not even started). So this inlet was mostly dry ground with scattered trash and dry docked boats. You can see the houses on stilts further off, on the other side of the inlet. There were some girls sitting and playing in the trash covered ground. There was a boat, which looked as if it had not seen the likes of water for a number of years. There appeared to be at least one family that lived there (possibly more, including the little girls we saw).</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_158387">I pray that I never become accustomed to seeing people living and playing in and around trash and non-sanitary conditions. There have been a couple of times during this trip that I wondered what would happen if I just got a bunch of trash bags. Started on my own to clean up various areas. Would the people follow suit? If we did get it all cleaned up, a fresh start... how long would it last? What other services do these people need?</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_158390">We wondered further up, past several other families that were apparently living in the barren wasteland of trash and mud. We came upon a larger section of inlet. Here there were hundreds of kids with kites. Talking in broken Portuguese and Spanish, we realized that the kids were having kite wars. I'm not sure if you have read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kite-Runner-Khaled-Hosseini/dp/1594480001" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.amazon.com/Kite-Runner-Khaled-Hosseini/dp/1594480001" target="_blank">The Kite Runner</a>&nbsp;(an excellent book, I'd highly recommend), but it was very similar to this. The strings were course enough to cut down another parties kite. We sat and watched them for some time, and it started to rain. First a couple of drops, then it seems the heaves open up and empties all of the stored water. The kids went running to their homes, only to drop off their kites or perhaps spoiled kite, and to grab their soccer balls. In the pouring rain, mud and trash you could see the children happy as could be playing futból. We waited out the pounding thunder, flashing lightning, and drenching rain with a beer and conversations.</p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="2048.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/52db6916e4b094736846c961/1390111003355/manaus-parks-kids-playing-soccer-rain.JPG" alt="  Kids Playing Soccer in the Rain  "/>   Kids Playing Soccer in the Rain  [/caption] 
  

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_163491">There were many good conversations, and even some half hatched future business ideas (a type of world restaurant) at the Port of Manaus. We took fellow travelers to see the prize we had found at the port. A Torre of beer. For about R$20 you can buy 350 ml of beer. It comes in a giant plastic cylinder complete with its own tap. The cylinder has a hole in top, and a frozen metal object gets stuck down keeping the beer cold. The servers exchange these often, and brought us orders of batata fritas (French fries) with toothpicks.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_163494">While we didn't eat at the discotech, we did have some drinks and attempted dancing. One of the nights we went out with a couple other travelers to one of the local discotechs (dance clubs). It was a lot of fun, and made me really want to learn to dance Forró (our hotel guy told us it came from somebody saying it was music “for all” and then made to be written in Portuguese). The entire time I was in Brazil, I did not see any Samba clubs (ether that, or Samba in the US is very different). I attempted to ask a number of girls to either dance with me or to teach me (my Portuguese is pretty horrible) but got shot down every time.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_163497">I did get a lot of action when we went to Bosque da Ciância. We went with some friends we had met at the hostel (Rachel and Naun). It was a thirty minute bus ride from the center of town, through the winding roads of the real Manaus. All of the houses have large fences with metal gates and broken glass on top of the walls. Some were nice, some weren't. We went past one area that had a little stream that ran behind the houses. You could see naked children, trash, and dirty water. We saw a lot of different animals there, probably more than we would if we had taken a jungle trek. We saw three types of monkeys (one being squirrel monkey). We saw freshwater manatees, a toucan, scarlet macaw, caiman, turtles, electric eels, and little jungle rodents. It was a great excursion, and well worth the R$2.</p><h2 id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_167047">Riverboat Ride Down the Amazon</h2>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_168668">The cheapest way to get down to Porto Velho is to take a boat down The Amazon. This was also one of our major goals for going into Brazil. It cost about R$170 for the four night trip. We arrived several hours before our boat was scheduled to leave for Porto Velho, and it was already jam packed with goods, hammocks (what we slept on during the trip), and people. Some of them had gotten there as early as the day before. We were hoping to see the meeting of the waters (of the yellow and black rivers that are the primary feeds to The Amazon) where you can see the different colored water running side by side, but we did not leave until very late (an several hours after our scheduled time). There was no room to sleep on the main sleeping deck, so we mistakenly brought our hammocks up to the bar on the top of the boat. There were a number of people who where were set up there, but we didn't realize just how hectic it would get.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_168671">After spending some time writing and watching the dark water we both laid down to sleep for the night. We were disturbed by the lady working at the bar screaming and locking up the store. Looking to the other end of the boat, we saw a group of three or four men yelling and chasing another Brazilian guy. Disoriented, we got out of our hammocks and saw that they were chasing the man with weapons. One guy had a large board that appeared to have rusty nails. Another guy had picked up a crutch and was chasing him. They came to our side of the boat, and Ami actually got trapped behind the guy they were attacking. I had to pull her out of the struggle before she could get hurt. We went down to the bottom of the boat and waited with the majority of the people. One of the guys appeared to be very injured (with a couple of large gashes, and possible broken arm and leg). In the morning, a police officer came on board and arrested two people, and they carried the injured one into port.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_168674">In the rush, Ami left her wallet and I left my cell phone in our hammocks. Ami had about R$100 stolen from her, and they took my cell phone. Apart from the loss, we ended up moving downstairs with everybody else and having a great rest of the trip. Boat riding down The Amazon (I say it's The Amazon, but technically it's one of its large tributaries) means dirty bathrooms, beautiful scenery, cards, writing/thinking, movies, and dolphins.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_168677">We saw a couple of freshwater pink dolphins, which are common to The Amazon. Ami saw her own personal dolphin. He jumped out of the water, almost completely exposing himself. I believe I saw a caiman, but I am not sure, and a ton of different species of birds. There were lots of different insects that lived on our boat also. The most annoying being this flying beetle that seemed to like to fall onto you. Once on the ground, it would run on its back, trying to get to safety. There were also a lot of bugs that appeared to enjoy the bathrooms.</p>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_172965">The bathrooms are small little rooms, with locks both inside and outside. Many of them don't have lights, so if you have to do any business at night it can be difficult. They have a shower that is almost over the toilet, and nowhere to place your hygiene supplies or clothes. A number of different types of moths, spiders, and sometimes cockroaches often inhabited them. Other then insects, the walls seemed to be tinged black by some sort of mold. They stunk of ammonia, and often had standing water inside. It was really quite the experience.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_172968">Every day we were provided with copious amounts of rice, beans, and noodles along with either beef or chicken. They often had a couple of slices of tomato to add to the concoction. Getting meals meant waiting in line for long periods of time until there was room at the table, then quickly eating your food so the next could come and eat.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_172971">I spent a considerable amount of time doing what I call meta thinking (thinking about thinking). I wrote down my personal mission statement (it's still not complete), read my bible and book, and wrote some letters (which I still haven't sent off a week later). It was also magnificent to stare off into the expanse of the jungle. It made me wonder at the grandness, and imagine a future trip that would be comprised of exploring the jungle and seeing if I could survive. It also made me wonder at how much life and biodiversity we couldn't see in the distance. The sunsets and the storms were amazing.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_172974">One night, we had a particularly large storm we traveled through. I donned my rain poncho, sunglasses (to keep the pelting rain out of my eyes), and went to the top of the boat to get drenched. There is something vastly different with the storms in South America and the ones in North America. The rain comes down in blankets here and thunder claps loud enough to feel it in your bones. It is a glorious thing. Me and Ami in our rain gear got a lot of laughs from all of the locals, who hid from the elements under the boat. When we finally landed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Velho" data-cke-saved-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Velho" target="_blank">Porto Velho</a>, we were happy to have real bathrooms and showers.</p><h2 id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_172980">Couchsurfing in Porto Velho<br></h2>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="2048.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/52db6a0ae4b049da5700c430/1390111256975/porto-vehlo-family-couchsurfing.JPG" alt="  Renata's Family who we Couch Surfed With  "/>   Renata's Family who we Couch Surfed With  [/caption] 
  

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_177521">In Porto Velho we stayed two nights with an amazing family through <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/" target="_blank">couchsurfing.org</a>. They were phenomenal people. Renata is a medical student, and loads of fun to hang out with. She lives with her mother, father and younger brother. Only Renata speaks English, but her family was so welcoming. We arrived on October 18th, which is my birthday. I was very happy to just spend time with their family and eat dinner together.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_177524">We also got to hang out with Renata's brother, who wanted to show us all the different foods we had to try while in Brazil. With her younger brother, I played some futból… which the language barrier doesn't seem to affect. We also taught Renata to play Texas Hold'em, and she taught us to play a local card game (Truca). To show our appreciation for their hospitality, we made some homemade lasagna.<br></p><h2 id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_180666">All We Want is to Leave Brazil</h2><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_177533">We took a six hour bus ride to Guajará-Mirim, the border town to cross into Bolivia. We took a night bus, with hopes to get the paperwork started early enter Bolivia. We were prepared to pay the USD$100 to enter Bolivia, but they did not want to accept us. Nobody at the consulate spoke English, so communication was difficult. The paperwork they gave us, apparently showed new requirements (not mentioned in our Rough Guide to South America). They require that US citizens have an official criminal background check. They told us that we would have to take a two day trip back to Brasilia to obtain the proper paperwork. That was our first attempt to leave.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_177536">We bought bus tickets to Rio Branco (heading to Assis Brasillia and the border to Perú) for the next morning. When we showed up to catch our bus, we were denied due to having an expired visa. We spent the rest of the day attempting to get our visa in Brazil extended. We transferred our bus tickets to the next morning (our second attempt to leave). The next morning we had complications in getting to the bus before they left. Again we had to transfer our tickets to the next day. Our third attempt to leave kind of turned into a fourth. We stayed at two different hotels while in Guajará-Mirim, Hotel Lima and Maylla Park Hotel. Maylla Park Hotel had the nicest people there.</p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="2048.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/t/52db6a9be4b04f03bead8071/1390111393942//img.jpg" alt="  Ferry Across the River  "/>   Ferry Across the River  [/caption] 
  

<p>One morning, I had gone downstairs to get some coffee. I had missed the breakfast, so I asked them to boil some water and I would use my own instant coffee. It must be said that Brazilians put a lot of sugar in their coffee. I put some in and went back to the room. About 10 minutes later, two of the maids came knocking on my door. They had brought a note written in Portuguese (they knew I understood Portuguese written more than spoken) and some sugar. They insisted that I put some more sugar in my coffee because they did not know I already had. Unable to describe myself properly I added lots more sugar to my coffee. But really, what caring and hospitable people!</p><p>We also met a guy who was driving his truck to Rio Branco. We decided to drive us (which makes it our fourth attempt to leave). We had the tickets transferred for one more day, and exchanged for money when we got to Rio Branco.</p><p>Rio Branco is a beautiful city that we spent one night in. It has a neat market, and beautiful streets. The next morning we successfully caught a bus to Assis Brazil. Assis is border town to enter Perú through. We spent one night there, playing pool at a local bar before going to sleep. The next morning we took two taxis, and a ferry to get to Puerto Maldonado. In Puerto Maldonado we have been lucky enough to get to hang out with some local traveling friends we met in Manaus. We have plans to spend some time in the jungle and do a number of other things I will hopefully write soon about.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I've recently broken my camera, so you can view the last of the photos I will be able to upload from my camera at its album <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.527146921626.2044835.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=46eff80871">Ayahuasca Vision Quest, an Overnight Jungle Trek, and Los Días de Los Muertos Facebook Album</a>. I will probably be uploading photos from Ami's camera (I apologize in advance for people who are friends with both of us for the duplicates in pictures).</p><p>We spent about a week in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Maldonado">Puerto Maldonado</a>, which (other than the broken camera) an exquisite trip. Two of our friends live there (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=696360594">Naun</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=698115556">Rachel</a>). It's one of the largest cities in the Amazonian region of Perú (Iquitos would be the other). It's more expensive than most of the rest of Perú, but still very cheap by US standards. In Perú they use the Nuevo Sol (New Sun) and the exchange rate, while it <a target="_blank" href="http://goo.gl/76GJW">fluctuates daily</a>) is about three sol's to every USD. The double room that Ami and me were staying in (Hostel Moderno) cost s/. 25 per night (or a little over USD$4 per night). We could eat a giant rice, soup, meat, and juice dinner for only s/. 3... which is so cheap. Some places are more touristy, and thus more expensive.</p><p>While we were in Puerto Maldonado we did go to a couple of the tourist restaurants. There we ate some traditional jungle food and jungle meat. I had wild jungle pig (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Peccary">Giant Peccary – Pecari Maximus</a>) and Ami had wild jungle rodent (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara">Capybara - Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris</a>). It was good although neither tasted like chicken. We also ate at a couple of great pizzerias, a chifa restaurant (Peruvian Chinese restaurant), and I ate some Juane on my jungle adventure.</p><p>We also ate some other unexpected stuff. We were in Puerto for a couple of days, I began to notice that Ami kept going off with Rachael to I figured plan something. I left to go to the bank one day, while we were all getting coffee and dessert and came back to Ami explaining about her birthday experience. Well, were sitting in the hostel room one day, and Naun and Rachael came by. Ami told me, “you need a hammock… and let's go.” I decided I needed pack a few more things, but I didn't know where we were going. I had figured this had something to do with my birthday, but I had not know that Ami had been planning it for almost two weeks.</p><p>I quickly packed my bags (because everybody was waiting for me), and we headed off on motorbikes. When we got outside of town, we switched drivers (I was riding with Naun and Ami with Rachael). Ami had been asking for days to be able to drive one of the motor scooters so I figured I ought to let her drive us, to where ever we were going. I second guessed myself after we started weaving back and forth across the road. When we came to the first bridge, Ami wasn't used to the breaking system and we made it more of a jump than a bridge.</p>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_210439">A little further down the road we ended up laying the scooter down, not going very quickly so nobody was hurt. After a little bit, and some adjustments of my giant backpack, and Ami got the driving down pretty pat. That's how it seemed at least. Let's just say that going uphill on a little scooter can be a dangerous endeavor. We had just gone over a bridge. The bridges in the jungle (for buses, trucks, motorcycles, and everything) are somewhat menacing. There have been a number of times on buses that I have been afraid that they would break. The generally contain two wide boards that are higher by about an inch then all of the crossbeams. While the wide boards would seem the more secure bet, they are too narrow to be easily navigated by bike. Taking a bike over the crossbeams has its own challenges too. Normally they are lower than the ground, and so there is always a bump getting on and off. By the end of the hour trip there and back both me and Ami became proficient at navigating these.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_210442">The steep dirt road hills are another story. After crossing one of these bridges, Ami started heading up this hill. About half way up, she decided that the bike was in too high of a gear. The combination of me (a good couple hundred pounds heavier than Ami) and my backpacking bag seemed too much for the bike. We road a wheelie for a couple of feet before the bike tipped over onto it's back. I kind of jumped off of the bike and fell back on my pack. My first response was to look at Ami's feet and legs to see if they were trapped along the hot metal. Her flip flop (not good riding equipment for either of us) was stuck between the tire and spokes. Out of instinct I grabbed for her leg and tried to make sure she was safe. In the process I managed to create some excess bubbling skin on my forearm (interestingly, it was right over a previous burn). We both came out alright, although Ami was pretty beat up. I drove the bike the rest of the way (only five minutes down the road) to the Shamans place.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_210445">[image]<br>[image]<br></p>

<p>When we finally arrived in the woods, and first found a wooden platform to set our hammocks on, was when I was first told what the present was. I was being brought into the middle of nowhere to do a vision quest with Ayahuasca (ayawaska pronounced [ajaˈwaska] in the Quechua language). This is a brewed mixture of a vine and some leaves that have psychoactive (hallucinogenic) proprieties. As we have been traveling I have met a number of people who have either taken Ayahuasca or San Pedro Cactus, and it has always been a thought to personally try these. One lady we met from the UK has been traveling around South America for the past several months after being diagnosed with a deadly brain tumor to just take Ayahuasca. She said that she had not been medically tested yet, but she was sure it was helping and that she had a number of physical manifestations.</p><p>Knowing that I have come to South America partly to find myself, and help figure out what I am supposed to do with my life… Ayahuasca seemed an interesting experience to have. I did have to spend some time deciding whether or not I would take it at that moment. It is a strange thing, to be brought somewhere and expected to take a hallucinogen without any type of preparation or forethought. We also almost did not perform the ceremony because the Shaman that Naun knew was performing a ceremony at another lodge that evening. We were left with his two understudies. Interestingly, they were gringos (i.e. foreigners).</p><p>All in all, there were the two stand in Shaman, Naun, Rachael, Ami, two girls from Spain, and me all participated in the experience. We sat on mats on the floor of a dark hut and took each took our turn of drinking the concoction. We drank about one half cup of the liquid, which both smelled and tasted bad. After about a half hour, they turned off the lights started chanting and shaking a maraca type instrument. Soon after, with my eyes closed I started hallucinating a bit. I, and almost everybody vomited. Vomiting is very normal with Ayahuasca, and supposed to symbolize cleansing the body. One member of our group continued to vomit through the entire night (not a very pleasant experience). While I did not seem to see my purpose or any type of future life vision I did see some other things.</p>

<p>I felt both very hot and cold at different points during the experience. At one point, I was sitting on the ground, and I felt like I was a giant ball of gravity… pulling everybody closer to me. I also experienced seeing a white light and seeing all of my thoughts running across this glass like surface as if they were ants. I also saw myself madly trying to type all of my thoughts down in a darkened room. All in all, it was an interesting experience. I would not say that it was life changing or vision forming. But it was very interesting.</p><p>I drove us the majority of the way back on the motor bike… but I ran into a similar problem as Ami did. While attempting to navigate a hill, I realized I was in too high of a gear I attempted to downshift. Ami fell off the back of the bike as we popped another wheelie. I was able to control the bike and not let it come crashing to the ground. While I was able to control the bike, I did end up spinning it in a circle (and revving up the engine at the same time because I was holding the gas with my hand). I nearly ran Ami over with the bike. Deciding that she did not want to ride with me anymore, I rode back with Naun and Ami with Rachel.</p><h2>Church Outreach Event</h2><p>A couple of nights later, next to the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_de_Armas">Plaza Armas</a> (the main square), there were people setting up for a concert that evening. Ami and I met a couple who are from Texas, and had been living here for the last four months. They are here to plant a church, and are planning to start an English language school. They also helped to set up the event that was happening later in the square.</p><p>The event was pretty spectacular. There were hundreds of people hanging out in the plaza, and around the stage. The event started with some awards for various groups involved. They then had a children's program which consisted of people in giant costumes, singing and dancing. Some of the pastors who spoke described Halloween (the day the event took place) as evil and of the Devil. They also told parents to not let their kids go out dancing or drinking. There was a number of human videos and dramas. The main event was a singer from Bolivia. It was amazing to see so many people worshiping, and dancing in the streets. At the end, they had an alter call and maybe 20 people came forward to commit their lives to Jesus. It was very exciting. Apparently the local pastors set up a free breakfast in the morning for the new converts to be able to better meet them.</p><h2>Tambopata National Reserve Jungle Trek</h2>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_223001">I got the amazing opportunity to go on a very cheap jungle trek. I went with a number of French speaking people, but it was still an amazing adventure. I showed up at the port at 6am, and we took an eight hour boat ride to make it fairly deep into the Tambopata National Reserve. The whole trip cost me less than USD$100… which is really an amazing price. The lodge that is across the river from where we were costs about USD$1,000 for a four night trek, making my price super cheap. During the boat ride, I saw a number of different birds and even a small clay lick for macaws. Macaws will eat the nutrients at the clay licks to help settle their stomachs giving them the ability to eat both ripe and un-ripe fruit. We also saw a couple of peccaries (wild jungle pigs). My necklace I recently bought has a tusk from one of the peccaries. It's also interesting that there were birds eating the little insects off of the peccaries that we passed.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_223004">When we arrived, we made camp and went for a swim. I had neglected to bring a tent, believing my hammock would be enough. Everybody thought that I was crazy. After our swim we had a candle lit dinner and went searching for caiman. I thought it was very funny that we were looking for caiman right next to where we were swimming a few hours before. Interestingly, the only caiman we saw was not more than a 2 minute walk down the beach from where we were. Apparently they aren't much for attacking people. On our night walk, we also saw a little frog, a deadly snake, and some cool bugs that eyes glow.</p>

<p>I ended up not sleeping in my hammock, due to a killer rain storm. They made some room for me in one of the tents. From inside the tent the entire ceiling was constantly lit up by lightning and the ground seem to shake from the thunder. I donned my swimsuit to experience the storm fully, and found one of my fellow traveling companions tent completely flooded. After helping them in their midnight wet move, I stood out the storm. Me and four other guys stood out in the rain and finished the rum and coke that was left over from after dinner.</p><p>After a long stormy night, 4:30 am came very early. By about five we were in the boat and heading to the world largest known clay lick. We saw so many different types of birds. It was worth the early morning trek. After that, we returned to the camp to pack everything up. While I was heading out into the woods, to use the bathroom, I spotted a little jungle rodent. So much wildlife. After that we took a two hour jungle hike. It was very interesting to see so many different plants and animals. Some of them have really interesting stories. Make sure to check out the photos' linked above… because I describe about each on the photos themselves. Wildlife wise, we did see some squirrel and howler monkeys.</p><h2>Is South America Supposed to Be Cold?</h2><p>We took an 15 hour bus ride from Puerto Maldonado to Cusco Peru. Arriving at about 6:30 AM we decided that Cusco is a very cold place. During the day's it's about mid 70's to low 80's, and just above freezing during the night. Although we both took medicine for altitude sickness (Cusco is 3,310 m), and drank coca tea… we both ended up not feeling the best. For about two days I have been very sick… barely wanting to leave my bed to eat. But finally this morning I am feeling better.</p><p>We spent the first couple of nights couchsurfing, but are now staying at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pirwahostelscusco.com/backpackersperu.html">Pirwa Colonial Backpackers Hostel</a>. When we were couchsurfing it was an interesting experience. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/thehousecusco/">The guy</a>&nbsp;we stayed with, owned an extra two bedroom apartment and we stayed there by ourselves. He was very nice. Currently we will be starting to do <a target="_blank" href="http://yanapay.facipub.com/index.php?fp_plantilla_seleccionada_temporal=72">volunteering</a> on Monday. We are also looking for apartments and jobs. We believe we will be staying at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.saexplorers.org/club/home">South American Explores Club</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I started working more often with kids incarcerated at the Juvenile Detention in Kennewick. &nbsp;Minnie is still working for the Sunnyside School District, but she changed school to be working at Washington Elementary but she still misses her little goobers at Outlook Elementary.</p>

<p>We’ve both been living and laughing a lot. &nbsp;Minnie spent the fourth of July with good friends camping on the Oregon coast. &nbsp;Spent good times with friends, went for her first hike in Wenatchee, and rediscovered herself on the beach. &nbsp;I was making trips back and forth to Spokane, still feeling a little culture shock from having returned from my jaunt down to South America, having fun with friends, and trying to get more stable.&nbsp;</p><p>For both of us the biggest story has been us meeting each other. &nbsp;We started going to Eastlake Church. &nbsp;We’ve been volunteering at My Friends Place. &nbsp;Along with our friend Charlie tried to give survival kits to kids on the only super snowy day yet this year, driving around trying to find any kids outside to tell them all about the new homeless shelter. &nbsp;Spending Thanksgiving with both of our families worked out beautifully. &nbsp;We spent some time with my mom and extended family and some time with Minnie’s family and we even found time to accidentally explore Aberdeen (Kirk Cobain’s home town and where his ashes were laid to rest).</p><p>Wishing you and yours a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Years! &nbsp;We hope all is well with you and your family. &nbsp;We would love to talk to you or spend some time with you. &nbsp;Let us know how your life has been going. &nbsp;Come check out our new apartment.</p><p>God Bless, &nbsp;<br />Jacob &amp; Minnie</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ayn Rand’s classic Atlas Shrugged (<a class="external-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UZHTDM">Amazon</a>&nbsp;||&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Atlas_Shrugged.html?id=C9aBpwAACAAJ">Google Books</a>] is an enthralling novel with lots of conservative political implications done in the opposite of brevity. My friend Ami, carried this book probably weighing at least five pounds across most of our&nbsp;<a href="http://02b90a7.netsolhost.com/blog/jaunt-down-south-2010">Jaunt Down to South America</a>. I wondered at the time why she continued to pack the heavy book in her bag and heft it onto her shoulders every day. Even without having read the book, it sparked a number of interesting discussions between us as she leafed through it’s pages.</p><p>I decided that it was finally time for me to go through this highly acclaimed book. Instead of trying to take the time to read the book word for word, I decided to purchase the Unabridged Atlas Shrugged Audio Book and listed to it on my drive back and forth to work, and as I got further into the story I found myself listening to it at times I should have been sleeping.</p><p>The book examines in my experience, rarely for the genre, mainly a dystopia coupled with a remnant of a utopia. It explores a great number of topics through its story format and it is nearly impossible to miss the conservative political leanings of Ayrn Rand. It takes place in a world where the world has apparently become communistic (i.e. all of the countries are labeled “The Peoples State of Germany” [or fill in the country name]). In this dystopian world, the main protagonists (business men and women and industrialists) are disappearing from the world. The struggle mainly follows Dagny Taggart, the vice president of a transcontinental railroad and her never ending struggle to find “men of ability” and produce in a society of “looters.”</p><p>Throughout the novel, it addresses a number of different topics through its story format. Mostly indirectly it seems to me to address communism verses capitalism through a number of smaller topics. It looks at education and philosophy, victim and what Hank Rearden refers to as the sanction of the victim, government and business, and property rights.</p><h3>Discussion of the Book</h3><p>I found the novel to be particularly enthralling. While, I don’t necessarily believe the argument is a based argument as the author appears to lay out. The is most undoubtedly coming from a very right and conservative leaning stance. If the book can be considered an argument for capitalism, limited government, and social welfare I don’t believe that it lays out a fair argument. In it’s entirety, there is not one logical non-obtuse antagonist. The novels puts the concepts of social welfare and progressivism out like a straw man type of argument. All of the antagonistic characters are all quite deft and you just have to hate them and be rooting for the industrialists and business people. I wouldn’t disagree with rooting for these people, I truly do and have no problem with them.</p><p>For my own political leanings, I tend to describe myself as idealistically conservative but pragmatically highly liberal. You can read more about why my political stance is like this from something I wrote while in South America,&nbsp;<a href="http://02b90a7.netsolhost.com/blog/2009/09/out-trinidad-tobago-and-new-world-venezuela">Out of Trinidad &amp; Tobago and into the New World of Venezuela</a>.</p><p>One other thought about this this book, although I could and probably should write a lot more because there is so much in there, is about the concept of people with ability. There is a lot of argument about people of ability in the book and that it is not right to force them to pay for the “looters” who are without ability. All of the antagonists in the book are truly made up of people who could, with work, be people of action and ability it would seem. The book doesn’t address one bit societies need to help the most helpless and those who don’t have ability, especially those who are disabled. In my work, more and more, I find myself working with people who can not work (by definition for our services, somebody must not be able to work or must be on TANIF). While I do have clients that I could see doing some work, their disabilities make them highly undesirable for an employer and anybody that would hire them would have to make many sacrifices to keep them employed and I would imagine that they wouldn’t be financially productive for the company (don’t get me wrong, I’d love to have some employers like this… but it’s pretty uncommon). But then, I also have clients who I can’t really imagine doing any work currently due to their mental heath disabilities. They tend to be homeless, and have major psychosis that would extremely limit their ability to even do a job, less likely have clean and presentable clothes. I wonder in Rand’s utopia of Atlantis, who takes care of these people?</p><p>All in all, I would highly recommend the book, or the audiobook if your like me and have a long commute (although it was pretty pricey at about $30.). If you’ve read it, let me know what you thought, because I really only glossed over some major topics of the book and it’s such a long and deep piece of writing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>First DIY Project, Useful Cup Holder for the Couch</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/3/first-diy-project-useful-cup-holder-for-the-couch</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the first&nbsp;<a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/tags/diy">DIY (Do It Yourself)</a>&nbsp;project I've done for my blog. As I've been moving towards home ownership, I've been enamored by&nbsp;<a href="http://pinterest.com/campjacob/">Pinterest</a>&nbsp;and all of the projects I'd like to take on at the home I'd like to buy. Actually, I've completed a purchase and sale agreement with the owner and the paperwork is being process by the bank. You can see the home posted for sale by owner on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1119-W-Irving-St-Pasco-WA-99301/23341266_zpid/">Zillow at 1119 W Irving Street</a>. It's a pretty amazing house. I'm sure in a month or two we will be inviting friends over for a house warming party (no need to bring stuff). While the home is pretty well done, it sounds exciting for the moment to think about personalizing the house. Who knows if that's how I'll feel in a year, but for now it's fun to think fondly about weekends spent working on my home.</p><p>That being said, I worked on my first DIY project, even though we are still living with Minnie's dad. The idea actually came from visiting my mom a couple of weekends ago. She recently got a brand new couch. It's really nice, one of those two seater couches with an armrest / cup holder in the middle of them and lazy boy's on either side. I noticed that both of them had placed coasters over the cup holders, due to their glasses being too large to fit into the cup holder. I found myself worrying that the coasters would move. I thought about pasting something to the coaster bottom that fits snuggly into the cup holder, and then no worries about the coaster moving.</p><p>You can see the problem first hand below</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

"/>  The built in cup holders for Minnie's dad's couch, for my&nbsp; DIY Project &nbsp;that I posted on my blog,&nbsp; First DIY Project, Useful Cup Holder for the Couch . [/caption] 
  

<p>I decided to go out to Good Will and found a set of three clear glass coasters. Initially I didn't want clear glass coasters, but I was limited to what I could find in the thrift store in Sunny Side. They cost about $0.99, so pretty inexpensive. I also picked up some guerrilla glue and some a box of canning lids from the store. All together under $5.00. The picture displays that I bought the complete set of canning lids, but I ended up using only the circular inside section which you could purchase for cheaper. It had been my plan to use the outer ring as the piece, but I found that having bought the wide mouth lids, it didn't fit into the cup holders. I tried to cut them down, but found I didn't have any sufficient tools to do the job. The inserts were the perfect size, and it turned out looking better then I had thought. Below are the utensils used.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was pretty simple, once I decided to use the canning lids inserts (the flat round pieces). Basically I just glued them to each other with plenty of gorilla glue and then I glued it on the bottom of the coaster. You can see the final product below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <title>It Starts Again</title>
      <link>/blog/2011/9/it-starts-again</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been been doing graphic and web design stuff for the last several years. It all started with an original blogspot website . My friends all started posting blogs and I created my own. Later I learned that I wanted to change how the blog looked and felt. I started teaching myself a little bit both doing some of my own graphical design and webdesign. After a while, I figured I wanted greater control and to create my own website. I used some free space from my ISP. I out grew that, and decided I wanted greater control over my site and the ability to employ <a href="http://www.php.net/" title="PHP Programing Language Official Website">PHP</a>. I purchased my own web hosting and domain name. I built a pretty extensive website using <a href="http://wordpress.org/" title="WordPress Official Website">WordPress</a> as my blog software and creating static PHP pages with different functioning. After going through my entire website and having to update a few things a couple of times, I decided it was time to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Management_System" title="Article on Wikipedia regarding Content Management Systems">CMS</a>. I started using <a href="http://drupal.org/" title="Drupal Official Website">Drupal</a> as a CMS. I spent a lot of time, and had placed all of my static pages onto Drupal's system and designed it how I liked it. I started to learn to change some basic structural components of the system to the way I liked it. Then Drupal upgraded to a complete new version. Since I am always looking for the newest greatest thing, I upgraded my site. I lost all of my data as it was structured in the process. I have all of the backup files, but I can't just import it. I lost a couple of hundred pages and my blog articles. I'm especially sad, because I had recorded many of my travels through Europe and South America. I'm hoping to make this site better then it was before and with more enhancements. My website was down for a long time, and now I'm starting fresh... I won't lie. It will probably take me quite a while to get back to where I was before, but I will work on it. I hope you enjoy what you find and I always appreciate comments.</p>

      <title>A Look into Joining the Irresistible Revolution</title>
      <link>/blog/2011/12/a-look-into-joining-the-irresistible-revolution</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390194662224_29008">I have been making a determined effort as of late, to push myself to read more. I try to spend some time in the morning reading my devotional (<a href="http://utmost.org/" data-cke-saved-href="http://utmost.org/" target="_blank"><em>My Utmost for His Highest</em> by Oswald Chambers</a>) and my bible first thing in the morning with my morning coffee, news, and cigarette (yeah, I know that isn't conventionally acceptable to say at church and my mom keeps telling me I need to quit). I have also been reading at night before going to sleep. It's been a great habit for me to get into. The latest book that I have finished has been <a href="http://thesimpleway.org/store/product/the-irresistible-revolution/" id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390194662224_29910" data-cke-saved-href="http://thesimpleway.org/store/product/the-irresistible-revolution/" target="_blank"><em>The irresistible revolution: Living as an ordinary radical</em>&nbsp;by Shane Claiborne (2006)</a>.</p>
 
   <object width="512" height="288"><param name="movie" value="http://www.hulu.com/aol/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fwatch%2F306319%2Fthe-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-indecision-2012-mittstorm/embed/5UsOI8jLGN36hTbdUDY3GA"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.hulu.com/aol/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fwatch%2F306319%2Fthe-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-indecision-2012-mittstorm/embed/5UsOI8jLGN36hTbdUDY3GA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"  width="512" height="288" allowFullScreen="true"></embed></object>
 
<p>I might add, that by just finished I mean as in this morning unlike <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/306319/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-indecision-2012-mittstorm">Mitt Romney is chided by Jon Stewart</a>, see video below. There have been a couple of books which I feel have been very transformational to me. In reading Claiborne's book, I think that it will fit into that category. The back of the book describes the book as being invited into a movement which begins in our hearts and extends though our hands into a broken world. They say that this book with both "comfort the disturbed, and disturb the comfortable." I will say as I have been comfortable, I have been disturbed some by my comfort through this book.</p><p>One of my co-workers, Jamie, gave me a copy of this book. She suggested as we have talked about purposeful communities and communal living. The idea of community and communal living is something that I have scribed on my heart and something I have longed for. Since being in the Master's Commission I can remember talking to people about wanting "to start my own commune" (I often phrase it like that to see what type of reaction I will get out of people). While it is not in the scope of this post to lay out the vision that I have (and it's not to start a cult, so don't worry) I will try to spend some time not just talking about it, but I will write it so that you can read about it too.</p><p>Claiborne is one of the founding members of <a target="_blank" href="http://thesimpleway.org/">The Simple Way</a>, as they describe it on their website "The Simple Way is a web of subversive friends, conspiring to spread the vision of 'Loving God, Loving People, and Following Jesus' in our neighborhoods and in our world." It is communal living that happens in Philadelphia.</p><p>I think one of the reasons that the book disturbed me so much (in a good way) was because of the issues that it touched on. Claiborne seems to sum up their movement as the following:</p><figure >
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>We are just trying to discover a new (ancient) kind of Christianity. We are about spreading a way of life that exists organically and relationally and is marked by such a brilliant love and grace that no one could resist it.<span>&#148;</span>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390194662224_32694">While this is simple he discusses how this relates to parts of our life in way's I hadn't thought of before. He describes in real terms what it means to love our enemies and gives the strongest case for non-violence I've read so far. He described what it means to live with and love the poor. When I've thought of being in a community, it didn't change my desire to still be a part of the middle class even though I've always thought the community should be located in the ghetto. He describes about whether or not he should have health care (when people around him aren't able to afford it). He describes about church tithes and how the church shouldn't be using the majority of their funds to pay for buildings or for workers but should be giving to those in need. All differences in topics I haven't taken time to critically think about.</p><p>I would highly suggest the book. I will say that it is very Christian oriented, but even if you aren't a believer and are what he Claiborne describes as an activist I think it would be a great read. You can find it on <a target="_blank" href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_irresistible_revolution.html?id=70hRLTVBNnAC">Google Books</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Irresistible-Revolution-Living-Ordinary-Radical/dp/0310266300">Amazon</a>&nbsp;or their own website.The other thing that it made me hungry for was a difference in my profession. I love my clients that I work with, but I have been becoming fed up with the bureaucracy that is present to work in mental health. I long for living and working in ways that he describes. He describes that their daily living looks like the following.</p><figure >
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>It’s a little easier to describe an ‘average’ week. We have prayer each morning (at 8am). Then we dive into days that are filled with things like hanging with friends in the neighborhood or folks living on the streets, helping kids with homework, and helping folks get to appointments. We’ve got some lovely gardens and a little neighborhood thrift store. Most of us work jobs part-time and that frees us up to do other stuff we don’t get paid to do, but love. Activities and programs change from time to time, but we share food with lots of families, and try to be good neighbors. We have dinners together each week, and we have a Sabbath one day each week where everything rests. There are times where we have other things that grab our attention around some of the systemic injustices around us. Right now we are working hard to end gun violence on our streets, and to create some local jobs and more stable housing for folks. It’s not always sexy. In fact, we had some visitors that lived here for a week, and at the end of it we asked them what they learned. They said, ‘We learned it’s not that spectacular, and that we can do this right where we are.’ That’s a good word.<span>&#148;</span>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390194662224_33633">It made me hungry to not be worried about if my productivity is high enough or if I'm meeting my timelines for meeting with clients. To just be free to do what comes up and what needs are present. To not be worried if my clients know each other and their confidentiality might be broken. To not have to call them my clients, but to be a friend to those in need, not just a worker. I recently told one of my co-workers that I think if I got laid off it would be a good thing. Then I could go and do something more radical. Maybe join the occupy movement or something.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This Christmas Holiday has been pretty amazing. It was chocked full of all kinds of fun adventures. You can check out my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.618082915166.2087087.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=072fa4db0d">The Nowell 2011 Story Facebook Album</a>&nbsp;or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2543395822856.2121322.1192543209&amp;type=1">Minnie's Untitled Facebook Album</a>.</p><p>We got to go to the Christmas Party for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elijahfamilyhomes.org/">Elijah Family Homes</a>. We got to see some old friends and meet new people. We even got take a picture with Santa Clause. It was a good event. It gives everybody connected with Elijah Family Homes the ability to meet each other. They have a big dinner, games / crafts for kids, and give all the family presents. It also gives possible new family referrals meet everybody.</p><p>Other than agency parties, giving gifts is another important part of Christmas. Some other clinician at my <a target="_blank" href="http://tcc-health.org/locations.php?id=6">Nueva Esperanza</a> all referred clients to <a target="_blank" href="http://richland.bethel-church.org/blog/2011/10/26/operation-christmas-child/">Bethel Church for their Operation Christmas Child</a>. I got to play Santa, and deliver the presents for my clients. The company van was so full; I had to make two trips.</p><p>Minnie and I spent Thursday driving around and looking at lights. For both Thursday and Friday we drove around looking at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2011/12/18/1757314/mid-columbias-2011-christmas-lights.html">Christmas Light Displays listed on the Tri-City Harold</a>. My favorite wasn't listed in the Harold, was a house that I enjoy checking out every year in Richland. Not only do they have a great light display, but they put up thousands of figurines. After some hot coco and driving looking at lights we found our way to the <a target="_blank" href="http://cojchurch.org/2011/12/01/living-nativity-2011/">Cathedral of Joy's 2011 Living Nativity</a>.</p>

<p>Friday we went to church (http://www.eastlaketricities.com/). They decided to have church on "Christmas Adam" (i.e. The day before Christmas Eve). They said that they didn't want to have church on Christmas Eve or Christmas so everybody could spend it with family and friends. They've also canceled church for next weekend. Our pastor said that it would go against what the church was trying to do. He said that we are focused on reaching the unchurched. He said that he didn't know any of his friends that don't go to church that he could pay enough to come to church New Year's Day.</p><p>Saturday and Sunday we went back and forth between Prosser and Richland visiting Minnie and my parents...</p><p>As we were driving around looking at all the lights, it made me think about Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. I was thinking about how many people are working on their basic needs (i.e. food, shelter, food, security) while there are so many people who don’t even have to (or want to in most cases) think about those things.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Corpus Christi, Fashion Show, and Tipon... a Good Week</title>

<p>This week I got to do a couple of fun things, including getting my camera back so you can check out my photos The Title Of The Album. On Thursday was <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Christi_(feast)">Corpus Christi</a> (<em>latin</em> for Body of Christ). In <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusco">Cusco Peru</a> (and only in Cusco as I understand it) it is a public holiday, which meant I didn't have to go to work. First thing we attended the pontifical mass outside of the Cathedral. After the mass, there was a procession that made a loop around the Plaza de Armas. The precession is led by a silver plated alter called the Carroza de Plata (in _English_ Silver Chariot or also known as the Templete (alter), or Baldaquino (canopy)) that is pushed around the square. Afterwards they have various images of saints that are also included in the procession. After the procession we left to go to Plaza San Fransisco to buy some chiriuchu. Chiriuchu is a typical cold dish that includes various Inca foods, especially meats (a part of why I really liked it). It includes: chicken, cuy al horno (roasted guinea pig), Chalona (mixture of pork and alpaca) salt fish eggs, sasauge, seaweed, corn, andeanen cheese, pepers, and rocoto peper (a spicy peper).</p>

<p>On Friday night, I got the opportunity to go to the Cusco 2010 Alpaca Fashion Show. We got some free tickets, and it was interesting. They even had Miss Peru International there… although sorry, didn't get any photos. There were several sets of typical dances during the event along with three older ladies describing how to die various colors in Alpaca. As for the models themselves, I think most of them were just college students that they asked to come and show off some of the alpaca fashions. The event started much later then is traditionally Pervian, almost two hours. It was interesting, but it was outside and very cold so we left early.</p><p>On Sunday, we went to the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip%C3%B3n">Tipón Archeological Site</a>. This is a set of Inca agricultural terraces. It's very beautiful with the backdrop of the mountains. Afterwards we went to Lucre and ate duck and fresh pastries… so delicious.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery Promotional Video</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/10/safe-harbor-crisis-nursery-promotional-video</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really enjoy doing a little bit of graphic and web design, it seems like a good hobby. Sometimes it can take up just a little bit too much time, but I generally enjoy it (unless it's one of those times that I just can't seem to get my computer to do what I see in my head.</p>

<p>So, I guess more than graphic and web design now, I've made my first movie. Well, maybe it's not really my first movie, but one of my first "real movie." I've put together slide shows and that sort of thing a couple of times in <a href="http://goo.gl/a8RO" title="Window's Live Movie Maker">Windows Live Movie Maker</a>. It's a super easy to use program, and has served my purposes well. When I was asked to create a promotional video for <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org" title="Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery">Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery</a> I figured I'd play around with the untouched <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/" title="Adobe Premier Pro">Adobe Premier Pro</a> I have on my computer and see what I could do. While the video is probably about the same type of quality that I could have made with the basic windows program, it was interesting to learn a little bit about another design type.</p>

<p>So below is the video I created for Safe Harbor and loaded on YouTube (<a href="http://youtu.be/Xjuu5fpbAKc" title="View on YouTube">View video on YouTube</a>) for your viewing pleasure. I must say the video is not the best quality, but I guess it works for my first attempt. If any of you have any helpful tips for making it better, let me know.</p>

      <title>2010 Beggars Banquet Excitement</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/11/2010-beggars-banquet-excitement</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, I got the opportunity to go to <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org" title="Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery">Safe Harbor's</a> annual Beggars Banquet. It was a really great event, and so much bigger then I've seen it. It had been several years since I was able to go to the last event, and it has changed drastically and really gave me some great prospective on doing some fundraising events. Years ago, when I last went they were in the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/vqtv" title="Google Maps, Old Country Buffet">Old Country Buffet</a>, maybe had a 100 people, and made something like $5,000. A lot has changed since I've come back to the Tri-Cities.</p>

<p>This years event, and last years for that matter, took place at the <a href="http://www.threeriversconventioncenter.com/" title="Three Rivers Convention Center">Three Rivers Convention Center</a>, a wonderful venue. The main feature of this annual event is local restaurants bring in their best soup. The event drew about 800 participants this year and a small army of volunteers. Volunteers even included Miss Tri-Cities and Miss Columbia Basin. I spent my time volunteering taking pictures of the event (although I didn't load them on my laptop, so I'm not posting any as of yet). There was a silent auction of gift baskets and beautifully decorated Christmas trees. There was also a live auction of lots of cool items, with the hottest selling item being one of the board members preparing a five different dinners for groups of 8 people selling for I believe $500 a pop. Pretty amazing. They also had a number of drawings, raffles, and even a card game. They've really come up with some innovative ways of getting money, with even just a live donation time at the end. This year, before paying for all of the events costs, they came up with about $50,000, which is absolutely amazing! That's about $20,000 more then they made the previous year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Gun Violence &amp; Mental Health</title>

"/>  A graphic I created in Adobe Photoshop as a graphic thinking about all of the debate regarding mental health treatment and the gun control. [/caption] 
  

<p>Over the last few years and especially over the last couple of months since the&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting">Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting</a>&nbsp;both mental health and gun violence have been all over the news, radio, and political discussion. It's an immensely difficult and polarizing topic that is flooding every source of media. I figured I should add to it a little bit as I feel there is some misperceptions, especially regarding the mental health aspect.</p><div><p></p><p>One media source I find myself waiting expectantly to hear from every week and see what their latest episode is&nbsp;<a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/tags/freakonomics">Freakonomics Podcast</a>&nbsp;and have written about about before. I truly believe they put forth in-depth and thoughtful commentary and ideas, I must say I disagree with some of the comments that offhandedly given by Steven Levett in their episode&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2013/02/14/how-to-think-about-guns-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/">How to Think About Guns: A New Freakonomics Radio Podcast</a>. He describes that one way he would deal with these types of mass shootings is maybe to bring back more hospitalizations for mentally ill persons. While I agree that in some cases long-term hospitalization is something that would be beneficial for some of our chronically mentally ill citizens, it is for different reasons.</p><p></p><p>I have a number of clients currently who I believe could benefit from long-term hospitalization due to being gravely disabled. This is not so much based on my concerns that they will be violent towards others (or even necessarily themselves which is, in my experience, the more prominent reason that people are involuntarily hospitalized in this area). More so it is that they lack the basic comprehension and understanding to function in regular life (i.e. have a job, have an apartment, buy food... etc) because of the severity of their disability and oftentimes psychosis. That being said, belief that locking up more mentally ill persons would help keep us safer is very off base. Research shows that statistically mentally ill persons are no more likely to be violent then persons who do not have mental health conditions. The New York Times even put out an article, titled,&nbsp;<a class="external-link&quot;" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/health/a-misguided-focus-on-mental-illness-in-gun-control-debate.html?_r=0">In Gun Debate, a Misguided Focus on Mental Illness</a>&nbsp;which discusses this. If your interested, I could link in the future to more peer reviewed journal articles which look at the correlation of violence and mental illness.</p>I do agree that topics that are being discussed about gun violence and what politicians are proposing to help curb this violence are as the saying goes "a day late and a dollar short" although this is a vast understatement. I think if we really want to address gun violence and mental health, we should be finding ways of curbing suicide rates which make up the vast majority of gun violence and could be effectively changed in our country more so then the mass murders we are seeing on the rise.<p></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I'm very thankful for all of the support that we got to complete some of the&nbsp;<a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/tagsI/pasco-discovery-coalition">Pasco Discovery Coalition's</a>&nbsp;Annual Community Survey. We had people from the Coalition itself and some people from&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://www.firmeoutreach.org/About-Us.html">F.I.R.M.E.</a>&nbsp;along with Jesse's church members</p><p class="field-item even"></p><p>I'm assuming that I will post something after we have more of the survey's back and after the data analysis has been completed in my&nbsp;<a href="http://jacobrcampbell/resources">Resources Section</a>, but I wanted to post that the data collection we did today went really well. A group of about 13 of us went around the Lakeview Mobile Home Park in Pasco and were able to reach almost all of the trailers there. People seemed to be very receptive and we might have even found more coalition members to participation in our monthly meetings. It was cold, but everybody was a trooper and had great attitudes. We were hoping to do more survey's of East Pasco but ran into problems with not having a large enough volunteer base and enough time.</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Atomic Throw Down Poster Designs</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/1/atomic-throw-down-poster-designs</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while ago, I was doing quite a few poster designs for <a href="http://www.nscrossfit.com">Natural Selection CrossFit</a> (<a href="http://fb.com/nsxfit">Facebook</a>).  I do really doing graphic design projects, although lately I feel I have been too busy to do much of it.  This project took almost 20 hours to put together, and went through a number of iterations.  When I was first talking to the client, they described wanting something <strong>Superbowlish</strong> because the event will be taking place on Superbowl Sunday, (you can <a href="http://fb.com/events/651206994943583/">sign up to participate</a>).  The following are the first three design concepts I had.  I wasn't really too happy with any of them, and these are just quick mock ups and not final versions.</p>

<p>After going through putting these concept together, they had come up with a different design concept, one which I really liked and think turned out pretty awesome.  Retro looking posters are pretty cool, and they talked about wanting to have a design like the old school Pee Chee's.  You can see the 11x16 and the 8.5x11 versions of the posters.  I even made a cover image to go along with their Facebook page.</p>

<p>All in all it was a fun project. &nbsp;I'd love to know what you guy's think about the designs. &nbsp;I'm pretty satisfied with the final version.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This Thanksgiving has been pretty spectacular. It has been the first that I've split my holiday, and it has worked out really great. Minnie, my mom, and I started on Wednesday (I took the day off from work) and headed to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.longbeachwa.gov/">Long Beach Washington</a>&nbsp;to meet up with the rest of my family. We got to introduce Minnie to my mom and my tradition of listening to books on Tape as we go on road trips. It's a great way to pass the time. We listened to <a target="_blank" href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Daddy_s_Little_Girl.html?id=BhCTgme0DQYC">Daddy's Little Girl by Marry Higgins Clark</a>&nbsp;which is turning out to be a pretty great book (we should hopefully finish it on our way back tomorrow. On the way we stopped and had lunch in the Dalles and got to look at many of their beautiful murals (you can check out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.608386422016.2085754.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=92e1cfe379">Fun, Fundraisers, &amp; Thanksgiving 2011 Facebook Album</a>&nbsp;for all the pictures from the trip and some other stuff before). On the way we stopped in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.oldoregon.com/">Astoria</a>. While this is where <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089218/">The Goonies</a>&nbsp;and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099938/">Kindergarten Cop</a>&nbsp;were filmed, we didn't end up finding any of the shooting places. We ended up checking out the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.astoriacolumn.org/">The Astoria Column</a>&nbsp;and climbing to the top of the 164 steps. I will say that we had to go past a road closed sign (which my mom said she didn't see) and got told to leave by a city worker because of some "dangerous trees." For some reason my calves are still sore from the climb.</p><p>We made it to Long Beach, and met up with the rest of my family. My aunt and uncle let us use some of their points at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldmarktheclub.com/resorts/lg/">The WoldMark Club Long Beach</a>. It was nice, although it was much nicer to spend the time with all of my family. My extended family (aunts, uncles, cousins) are all close and we get together several times a year. Actually, speaking of Thanksgiving, that is something I'm super thankful for. We walked along the beach, played games, and talked. It was also the first time I've ever brought a girl to meet the rest of my family. It was pretty cool, and they all really loved Minnie.</p><p>Minnie and I decided that we should also see her family, we are here in Puyallup. Again, food, family, and fun. On our way over here, Minnie sent us on a detour to Aberdeen. I keep telling her that I'm going to fire her from being a navigator, but I think detours allow for new adventures. We found a small memorial to Kurt Cobain (a park with some signs) because he grew up there. It was hard to find, and really small. It but it was interesting.

<p>I'm getting more and more excite for my Trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco">San Francisco</a> for <a href="/http://www.macworldiworld.com">Macworld / iWorld</a> -- See my post <a href="https://jacob-campbell.squarespace.com/blog/2014/3/its-final-plan-tickets-bought">It's Final, Tickets Bought</a>. I'm currently sitting in the <a href="http://www.portseattle.org/Sea-Tac/Pages/default.aspx">SeaTac Airport</a>, waiting for my flight to leave in about an hour. I'm sure I will have more to share in the next couple of days (so expect to see some for frequent posts from me this week if I can get around to it.).</p>

<p>Last night I got to visit my aunt and cousin. It is so good to be able to get to spend time with family. In doing calculations, it seemed as if it wouldn't be much more expensive to stay somewhere and do the sleep and fly thing and not have to pay for parking. I had previously called <a href="http://www.knightsinn.com/hotels/washington/tukwila/knights-inn-sea-tac-airport/hotel-overview">Knights Inn Sea Tac Airport</a> and was told the price would be around $58. I calculated the cost for parking, it looked like it would be around $40, so the sleep, fly, park option seemed a great deal. It ended up costing closer to $88. I really dislike when things are somewhat deceptive.</p>

<p>Anyways, it all works out. While you wait for more posts, you can read <a href="/blog?category=Travel%20Blog">all of my former travel journals</a>, or my <a href="/blog?tag=Jaunt%20Down%20South%202010">Jaunt Down South 2010</a>, or <a href="/blog?tag=European%20Excursion%202008">European Excursion 2008</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Mi Vida Loca</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/4/mi-vida-loca</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="800.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/52db8ccbe4b0d691e03e028f/1390120141272/adobe-illustrator-mi-vida-loca.jpg" alt=" Mi Vida Loca or My Crazy Life "/>  Mi Vida Loca or My Crazy Life [/caption] 
  

<p>Mi Vida Loca, which translates to My Crazy Life. While three dots tattoo (placed on the hand between the index finger and thumb or by the eye) in a triangle shape is often used by gang members to signify gang life… I felt that with the month that I've had this month it was fitting to name this post Mi Vida Loca. No, I haven't been involved in any gang activity. I have had a really crazy month, full of bad luck. I'm kind of hoping that now that this is a new month, I will have gotten rid of all my bad luck and the good luck will start overflowing my cup.</p>

<p>This month has included a number of different things, to varying degrees could be considered bad luck. At the beginning of last month <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/my-blog/2010/03/15/students-protest-jacob-torres-goes-hospital">I had an operation</a>, with the end result being my gallbladder being removed. I had a number of risk factors going for me, pushing me towards gallstones and eventually having my gallbladder removed. While I have been in South America, I have lost a lot of weight (still waiting on my camera, so no photos of the thinner me) with is a risk factor. Another risk factor is fasting. I tend to not eat very well, and often forget to eat (only having one meal a day). I just get busy and then don't eat. Along with not eating well, often when I eat I love to eat greasy food. While I don't eat the same type of greasy food as I did in the US… I still get my opportunities. On the streets there is always little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticuchos" title="Anticuchos on Wikipedia">anticuchos</a> stands. These are women who barbecue meat (kind of like shish kabobs). One of my favorite snacks; coming in beef, heart, chicken, and sausage (really more of a hot dog). Along with anticuchos, there are always venders selling empanadas (although I prefer empanadas from Venezuela), and hamburger type things. Another favorite unhealthy dish I like is salchichapapas (which translates to sausage and french fries). Sometimes this comes with <a href="http://peru-recipes.com/2008/05/arroz-chaufa-chaufa-rice" title="Chaufa Rice Recipe">chaufa rice</a>, and again things they call sausages which are closer to hot dogs. So good, but kind of greasy. Other than eating unhealthy, I also don't drink enough water and have too much coffee or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Kola" title="Wikipidia Article">Inca Kola</a>. Combine all of this into my life and you get gallstones.</p>

<p>I've learned that it can be "fun" to have operations in third world countries. Every thing went just fine from the operation, and I am feeling back to normal. Although, I can't exactly eat anything that I want. Sometimes when I try to have the <em>Super Duper Norton's Burger</em> from <a href="http://www.nortonrats.com/" title="Nortons Rats Tavern">Nortons Rat's Tavern</a> my stomach feels like it has a brick in it. But other than that I've been able to eat most things again.</p>

<p>Other than having semi vital organs removed in third would countries, I've also had problems with cats. I've been house sitting for a Ecuadorian friend while she went home to visit family. It's been amazing, actually a nicer apartment then I've ever had. She had two cats (which living with cats has cemented my feeling that I don't want cats or like them). Although, I've don't like cats… I didn't intentionally lose one. I'm not sure what happened to one of her cats. It just disappeared one night (I still haven't told her). I think it either went out the window (second story) or must have snuk (while writing this post I found <a href="http://daggle.com/sneaked-versus-snuck-past-tense-versus-past-participle-73" title="Sneak and Snuck">an interesting article regarding snuck verses sneaked</a>) out the door one day.</p>

<p>Other than losing cats, I've also lost the girl I was seeing. I had been seeing a Peruvian girl for the last month, but the relationship just didn't seem to be working out so I had to break up with her. While I didn't lose my job, I did have to reapply for my job at the National University.</p>

<p>The final crazy thing that happened to me, was getting mugged. A couple of nights I was walking home fairly late. Right in front of my house (just a couple of doors down), three men jumped me. Only my pride was hurt, so I'm fine. I'm just one cell phone and a couple hundred Nuevo Soles shorter. All in all, it's been a pretty crazy month. But it's just another piece of my crazy life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This last week has been a really good one for me. I just got hired on at Tri-Cities Community Health (formerly Community Health Center La Clinca) as a case manager, which should be really fun. I'm not exactly sure what I'll be doing, but I'm assuming it will be a great learning experience.</p><p>The other thing that is very cool is that I just got a car. I've been looking at apartments, and I came across a really interesting website (<a target="_blank" href="http://walkscore.com/">Walk Score</a>). The website lets you enter an address and it rates how walkable that address is (i.e. closeness of stores, entertainment, public transportation... etc). It's a really interesting concept and something which is very on my mind since coming back from Peru.</p><p>Since coming back from Peru, one thing that has been hard to get used to is how much space / how spread out everything is in the US and especially in Tri-Cities. The neighbor hood that my mom lives in is not very walkable, scoring just a 30. I can believe this. The other day, my mom asked me if I could get some bread. I ended up walking to the nearest Albertsons, it only took me about 2 hours to go there and back. I think that this idea of a walk score is also important because of it's effect on the climate and feel of a city.</p><p>If things are more walkable in a city I believe that people are more likely to walk. It's healthier for the people in the community. It's healthier for the environment. And it's healthier for the community. It would make sense that if you are walking to various locations in your community you are more likely to know / meet people who live around you. Knowing your neighbors builds community solidarity and makes it a safer place to live.</p><p>I bring this up because of my other piece of cool news. I was going to go and buy a car. I figured with the income that I would be making and spreading it out over three years (normal car payment) I could easily afford a car payment for a $10,000 car. I found some really great cars. I found a 2001 Mercedes (fully loaded) that was super sexy that was under $10,000. Pretty amazing. While I would be able to afford the loan, and it would be a really fun car to own, one of my mom's friends offered to give me a car for FREE. So amazing. While it's not as sexy as a Mercedes, being a 1993 Mercury Sable Wagon, it is amazing to receive it for free... such a blessing. It does have some problems with it, and I need to get it in somewhere so it can get looked at, it is a free car. It will allow me to save up some money until I can have a better down payment (or pay cash) for a new car. The car doesn't have AC, but during the winter that shouldn't be a problem so maybe next summer I'll look into getting a new car. I was just so excited, that I wanted to share with everyone.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Birth Announcements and the Economics of Children</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="officialbirthannouncement">Official Birth Announcement</h2>

<p>You might be getting a postcard in the mail soon, as an official announcement of Mateo Rodman Campbell VSP's birth. If you don't, I'm sorry, and we don't mean any office to you what so ever. We have a lot of friends and family and it is hard to get the announcement out to everybody. I'm pretty proud of the work I did in creating the announcement. It took me a couple of tries and a lot of time thinking and deciding exactly what to do. My mom said that we'd better be careful, so somebody might call CPS on us (the card has little Mateo inside the oven, see below). Don't worry he was completely safe the whole time and was even laying on a blanket. Minnie was pretty freaked out though. Below is the front of the postcard announcement. Make sure to also check out the Mateo's Birth Announcement Postcard Back Version 2 and the version that I didn't use, Mateo's Birth Announcement Postcard Front Version 1.</p>

You can read my blog post about the birth,&nbsp; Are You Ready or Not? Proud Father .  This postcard, is the second version of two. I like it a lot better then the first version. I spent a long time looking through google images of baby announcements for some inspiration. I was struck by so many really creative ideas people had. I still didn't know what I wanted to do. After a little while, I was struck with a little bit of inspiration of my own. I didn't see anything like this, but I'm sure I'm not the first to think of putting my baby in the oven.&nbsp; Minnie &nbsp;was super worried (don't worry, the oven wasn't on... but she was still freaking out. We did a photo shoot with little Mateo in various pots and pans on the oven too, maybe I'll load them on Facebook at some point, but I haven't yet.  It's pretty simple design. I took a photo and placed it on the right hand side. I blurred out a section behind the text "Baked to Perfection." The various other portions are texts of different sizes and directions in a type of word cloud .

<p>It was a pretty fun process to go through and make it. Make sure to leave some comments and let me know what you think. Also, if you don't receive one in the next week or so, and feel really left out make sure to let us know and we will send you one (please note that we haven't even mailed them yet).</p>

<h2 id="theceogene">The CEO Gene</h2><p class="field-item even"></p><p>It always seems like I live a life of great serendipity. The other day, I'm still going through the old&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://www.freakonomics.com/">Freakonomics</a>&nbsp;podcasts. The two next ones were all about children / parenthood. The first one I listened to, was especially fitting as I am still tinkering around with the idea of starting my own business. It was tilted&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/06/03/the-church-of-scionology-full-transcript/">The Church of Scionology</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/08/03/new-freakonomics-radio-podcast-the-church-of-scionology/">listen to the Podcast</a>&nbsp;and hear great voice over repeating "Scion." over and over. I always love learning new words, and with my new addition to the family, really like this word.</p><blockquote><p>sci·on /ˈsīən/&nbsp;Noun</p><p>A young shoot or twig of a plant, esp. one cut for grafting or rooting.</p><p>A descendant of a notable family.</p></blockquote><p>They discuss a number of really interesting topics, and it is helpful that the two main companies they look into are related to beer (yes, Steven Dubner knows how to keep my attention). They get into discussion about the frequency in which companies that pass on their family buisness to a family member continue to succeed and that there really doesn't appear to be a "CEO Gene." I guess I must agree, for my little Mateo, with the Buffet Rule (both the one in the media recently and discussed on the podcast). I want my son to do what ever makes him happy and that he wants to do. That he would find his passion and follow after that. The other podcast that I listened to was&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/06/07/the-economist-guide-to-parenting-full-transcript/">The Economist’s Guide to Parenting</a>. Another great story that you should take time to listen to.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With my drive from Prosser Washington to Pasco twice a day, I've been listening to the&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://www.freakonomics.com/">Freakonomics Podcast</a>&nbsp;(something that you should check out if you haven't already... it will make you feel smarter). It's been really interesting, I'm I've had a lot of things that I've thought about writing about, but just haven't made time to write about yet. So you get my random thought of the day. The episode I was listening to was titled&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/05/26/freakonomics-radio-the-economics-of-bounty-hunting/">To Catch a Fugitive</a>&nbsp;which is all about the economics of bounty hunters. As always, it was a well put together episode that was informative. They discussed the efficacy and some of the tactics that bounty hunters use.</p><p>As I was listening to the podcast, I found myself wondering if I could be a bounty hunter. That led to thoughts of how mental health case managers (i.e. my current position) are like bounty hunters. The most obvious similarity is sometimes the general tasks required. Frequently I find myself trying to track down clients and engage with them. This might mean calling collaterals, going by their homes or places that they hang out, and trying to get them to re-engage in services. This especially true when they have an appointment with our psychiatrist and they haven't responded to say that they would show for their scheduled appointment.</p><p>They discussed that a good bounty hunter will build relationships with police and the community members. This also is true for case managers. I feel like an important part of my job is being the face of&nbsp;<a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/category/tags/nueva-esperanza-community-counseling-services">Tri-Cities Community Health</a>&nbsp;in the community, building relationships, networking to be better able to connect clients to resources, and everything in the community.</p><p>I find myself, as I am trying to connect people to resources in the community (especially at DSHS), waiting around a lot. This means I need to find ways to be industrious (i.e. making phone calls as I drive with my bluetooth, something else discussed that bounty hunters do) and that much of my job is boring. In the podcast I believe that Bob Burton said that bounty hunting is 90% work and 10% adrenaline. I guess on this point, while I may not be kicking doors down or handcuffing people, there is that 10% that is super exciting and engaging and that reminds me of why I do what I do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Some Words Are the Same</title>

<p>I’ve been living in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusco" title="Cusco Wikipedia Article">Cusco Perú</a> now for about two months (I believe a little bit longer). I haven’t really posted anything since getting to Cusco. My camera is still broken, so I don’t have any new photo’s for you yet. I hope that it will be out of the shop soon, although I don’t know if I currently have the $130 to pay for it for a couple of months.</p>

<p>While I’ve been in Cusco, I’ve done a number of things. Due to the focus of this post, I’m not going into all of the stories for these… but let’s just say I have a lot of stories to tell. I have...</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/campjacob" title="Couch Surfing Profile">Couch surfed</a></li>
<li>Paid 850 percent more than a shoe shine is worth</li>
<li>Looked for into purchasing a stolen phone for very cheap</li>
<li>Started my own business, with a fliers and logos and all</li>
<li><a href="http://yanapay.facipub.com/index.php?fp_plantilla_seleccionada_temporal=72" title="Yanapay Website">Volunteered working with little children</a></li>
<li>Passed out on the streets</li>
<li>Gone to the hospital (don’t worry, not for me)</li>
<li>Made friends with local artisans, flier hand-outers, drug dealers, travelers, and Cuscanian</li>
<li>Gotten hired as a professor at a <a href="http://www.unsaac.edu.pe/" title="UNSAAC">local university</a></li>
<li>Participated in a taxi protest</li>
<li>Spent Christmas in a bus</li>
<li>Often eaten a three course meal for less than a dollar</li>
<li>Almost gotten hit by fireworks on New Years</li>
<li>Eaten all sorts of food and drinks on the streets that should get me sick</li>
<li>Nearly gotten my wallet stolen</li>
<li>Had rock throwing protesters stop my bus</li>
<li>Taught personal classes in English</li>
</ul>

<p>Really all and all I’ve had a lot of other fun experiences. I really enjoy Cusco, and have been happy with my decision to make my camp here.</p>

<p>Now, one thing I haven’t done yet (and and hoping to) is take Spanish lesions. While I haven’t taken any formal Spanish classes, every day is a Spanish lesion for me. Whether it’s hanging out on the corner with the ladies who sell massages / tour packages or going to my church, I am always getting the opportunity to practice my Spanish. While there are a number of words which are very similar in English and Spanish, I don’t know of very many that cross the span of more than a couple of languages. I was sitting in church today, and it hit me that one word that I believe is universal is halleluiah.</p>

<p>When I was in Africa on my mission trip, the pastors would often get the congregation “riled up” by shouting BWANA ASIFIWE (praise the lord in Swahili). The congregation would shout back HALLELUIAH. The pastor would do this a number of times. While, I am not a master of languages and certainly do not know if halleluiah is pronounced the same in all the languages of the world I would guess that it might just be. I am fairly sure that I heard it in different nations in Europe, in Swahili, and in Spanish.</p>

<p>Doing a little bit of research, I understand that the word translated from Hebrew is Hallelujah – or Praise Jah (Jehovah) and translated from the Greek is Alleluia having the same meaning. Both are commands to praise the Lord.</p>

<p>I just found it very interesting that there would be this one command, to praise the Lord, that is so significant and not in other languages that it would show up the same in so many different cultures and languages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Can These Dry Bones Still be Raised, A Review on Chris Hodges's Death of the Liberal Class</title>

<p>As I generally do, I was listening to National Public Radio (my driving companion when I'm not listing to gangster rap) and I first heard a story <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=131166027">Hedges Laments The 'Death Of The Liberal Class'</a>. I was struck listening to Hodges talk about his life and the liberal class. It was a soon after that that I ended up being at <a target="_blank" href="http://g.co/maps/35gkx">Barnes &amp; Nobel</a>&nbsp;and quickly bought the book when I saw it. You must understand that this is about a year (I don't know why it took me so long to read it, it was really good), and I was spending a lot of time at anywhere that had wireless internet.</p><p>I started reading it for a while, and then I put it down for a while, but kept picking it back up. Don't let the fact that it took me a year to read cause you to believe that it's not a good book. It was very engrossing, educational, and inspirational in its own way. He goes from describing what the liberal class was originally, to how it has been dismantled and loss of the processes which used to inhabit and permit the class. My favorite chapter is the one on liberal defectors, because I feel it is always so powerful to hear peoples stories. The final chapter is about titled rebellion and encourages the reader to rebel against the system.</p><p>Other then the topics and information of the book, I especially enjoyed Hodges vocabulary. The following some of the words that were new to me (although in my little book there were a lot more that I wrote down):</p><p>While there is a lot of people much smarter then me that discuss what the significance of the Dry Bones Prophesy is in Ezekiel. I'm not claiming that God was talking about the liberal class (although that is kind of a funny thought due to how conservative some Christians appear to be. But I do think it is a very visual scene that could portray where the the liberal class is as Hodges describes it.</p><p>It is a book that I would highly recommend to read. I think it is timely right now, too. While it was written prior to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.occupytogether.org/">Occupy Wall street Movement</a>&nbsp;but I think that it is along the same lines.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390187336505_58434">&nbsp; * <a href="http://goo.gl/1mHBK" data-cke-saved-href="http://goo.gl/1mHBK" target="_blank">Tepid</a><br>&nbsp; * <a href="http://goo.gl/Xfymj" data-cke-saved-href="http://goo.gl/Xfymj" target="_blank">Bromide</a><br>&nbsp; * <a href="http://goo.gl/Ar1TY" data-cke-saved-href="http://goo.gl/Ar1TY" target="_blank">Misogyny</a><br>&nbsp; * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muckraker" data-cke-saved-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muckraker" target="_blank">Muckraker</a><br>&nbsp; * <a href="http://goo.gl/orZ3j" data-cke-saved-href="http://goo.gl/orZ3j" target="_blank">Deracinate</a><br>&nbsp; * <a href="http://goo.gl/600O5" data-cke-saved-href="http://goo.gl/600O5" target="_blank">Blight</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

It was at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/ZINFUL-Panini-Grill-Wine-Bar/111441516616?sk=info" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/ZINFUL-Panini-Grill-Wine-Bar/111441516616?sk=info" target="_blank">ZINFUL Panini Grill &amp; Wine Bar</a>. It has a old fashioned feel. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I also enjoyed the company. The YPTC meetings generally are about meeting everybody, talking about our professions and what we are currently involved with. It's always a good time.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390193399696_15440">The YPTC event was on Thursday. On Friday evening (after a busy day at work), we went strait to the Beggars Banquet 2011. This event is one of my favorite fundraisers that I attend yearly. They started doing it several years ago, and it was made up of a couple of dozen people inside <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org/" data-cke-saved-href="http://crisis-nursery.org/" target="_blank">Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery</a>. For the last couple of years they have been having the event at the <a href="http://www.threeriversconventioncenter.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.threeriversconventioncenter.com/" target="_blank">The Three Rivers Convention Centers</a>. It is a venue that can host 750 people. They packed it. I haven't had a chance to find out how well the event did this year, but it looked like it went well. It's a really fun event, that not only has both a live and silent auction, but it has a soup tasting contest. <a href="http://www.atomicalebrewpub.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.atomicalebrewpub.com/" target="_blank">Atomic Ale Brewpub &amp; Eatery</a>&nbsp;won with their Atomic Ale’d Red Potato Soup. As the evening wore on with the live auction (which seemed to do really well with a professional auctioneer), we along with Charlie and Christine. We decided that it must be time for a couple of drinks. We decided to go to the new coolest martini bar, <a href="http://www.twigsbistro.com/twigs-bistro-kennewick-location" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.twigsbistro.com/twigs-bistro-kennewick-location" target="_blank">Twigs Bistro &amp; Martini Bar</a>. I must say, the hype (which I've heard a lot of people talking about it) is true. I've been to their locations in Spokane, but it's nice to have something as classy in the Tri-Cities.<br></p>

<p>The other thing that it is nice to have in the Tri-Cities is a shelter for homeless teens (My Friends Place). You can read more about on my blog post for <a target="_blank" href="/blog/2011/10/the-lawyers-artists-ball-2011-for-my-friends-place">The Lawyers &amp; Artists Ball 2011 for My Friends Place</a>. Saturday morning we went and picked up fliers and survival kits. We went around Kennewick looking for teens to talk to and hand out stuff too. While (I think due to the snow) we didn't meet up with many kids, we did talk to quite a few. We got the opportunity to hear some peoples experiences. We met a girl who was a little bit older, but was pending homeless. She described that she has been having a lot of problems lately. We tried to share some resources with her. We met another lady who told us about her son that had committed suicide a couple of years ago, but had been homeless himself. When you feel like your not doing very much (i.e. passing out fliers or something), it's hard to recognize how much of an impact you can have. All of the other teens that we met said they knew people that needed it.</p><p>After being touched be the people we met, we went to he Yakima Valley for two Birthday parties. The next morning we went to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eastlaketricities.com/Default.aspx">Eastlake Tri-Cities</a>. It was the second time we've gone there, and we really like it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_266968">It's not uncommon for teachers in the United States to go on strike, but I don't believe I've ever heard of students doing the same. In Cusco Perú, it does seem like there are a lot of protests (when I was spending more time down at the main square, it seemed almost every day). Even seeing all of these protests, I was prepared for the students to go on strike at the National University where I work.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_266971">One may question how all of the students at a university might go on strike. Well, at UNSAAC (Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Abad del Cusco) the university is surrounded by a giant wall with only a couple of major gates for people to enter by. The students took anything they could find (i.e. chairs, desks, large logs) and propped them up inside the gate making them inoperable. Furthermore, they added their own chains and locks to the gates.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_266974">The students were protesting saying that the school was using biased and illegal hiring tactics. As I understood the argument, the students said the administration was not hiring the professors based on their skills / qualifications, but rather based on relationships (i.e. family, friends… etc). I was told that this was illegal for the university to do here in Peru. I just found it very interesting the university students here would take the time to protest these illegal hiring practices.</p><h2 id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_269429"><a href="#" id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_269593">Jacob Torres Goes to The Hospital<br></a></h2>

<p>I tend to think my Spanish has gotten pretty excellent in the last several months of being in Peru / South America. But I guess being in significant pain, tends to make pronunciation more difficult. Late last Monday, I had a guy couchsurfing at my place. I went to sleep about midnight, but woke up just a half hour later with extreme pain in my abdomen. I didn't know what was happening. I tried doing anything I could think of for the next two hours, but it just kept getting worse. Add to that some nausea, and I was ready to go to the hospital. I woke my couchsurfer up, and told him I had to go to the hospital. He ended up just sleeping at the house while I went. Finding a taxi at almost three in the morning was a little bit difficult and I had to walk for a ways.</p><p>Peruvian hospitals are interesting. They require you pay for everything in advance. So, when I walked into the doors I paid S/. 10,00 (a little over $3) to have a consultation with a doctor. Through out the night (I didn't end up leaving the hospital until about 1:00 pm the next day) I had to buy medications several times. The processes is you go to the pharmacy, who prints out a typed list / cost of the items you need. Then you go to the cashier to pay for the items. After words your return to the pharmacy to receive your items. At those hours they are all asleep too, so you have to knock and wait for them. Lets just say in extreme pain, this is not a fun activity. After receiving your medications, you return to the doctor so they can give them to you.</p><p>There is also no computerized intake process, and each area of the emergency they have to fill out new pieces of paper. At one point, I was asked what my last name was (which so far, I've seen spelled as the following: kambel, campbett, and cambell) and I attempted to spell it out. When I saw what the nurse was writing I told her it was all incorrect (todas es incorecto). She took that to mean my last name was Torres. I was in too much pain to change it. The thing is, that this is the name that went onto my form for my ultrasound (I believe that's what it was), the first piece of paper I got to start carrying from doctor to doctor. I started having to consistently tell the doctors why it said Torres on my paper and not Campbell.</p><p>The next afternoon I left feeling much better (I'm sure a little high from the drugs) and super hungry. I was told that I ought to come back if the pain returns and that I should stay away from greasy food. The diagnosis was that my gallbladder was enlarged, and possibly had stones. They told me if the pain continued I might have to come back for surgery. I couldn't do anything at that but laugh.</p><p>You must know, I have not had many surgeries in my life. Well, other than this one… just one. The other one was an appendectomy. The circumstances for this were a bit strange. I was 12 years old when it decided to happen and on vacation in Mexico. I must say it was quite an experience to have surgery done in Mexico. It seem ironic my only other surgery would happen outside of the US.</p><p>On Thursday the pain was back, and too much too bare again, so I went back to the emergency room. I was seen and given some medication, being told to come back in the morning at 5:00 am for surgery. I only made it until about 10:00 pm that evening. The pain was too much, so I returned and spent another night at the hospital.</p><p>My gallbladder was removed without complications, unless you consider the hospital loosing my shoes a complications (it's funnier if you know how much problems I've had with shoes in South America). I've been in the hospital for the last couple of days. While, the hospital is not as nice as those in the US or have as many accommodations… it has been just fine. It's also considerably cheaper. While I haven't been released, so I don't know my total bill, I was told to expect about $100 or less. Maybe the health care system in the US should take some pointers from Peru for how to keep costs down and make doctors visits more affordable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Playing with Automator Services and Apple Script</title>

<p>I've never really been a programmer, but I always have been a geek.  One thing that I think is kind of cool about my transition from Windows to a Mac has been a lot of the utilities.  One utility that I have tried a couple of times to play with, but I haven't found an interesting enough use (or been able to figure out how to do uses that I did want to do).  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automator_(software">Automator</a>) on the Mac is a pretty powerful application.  Doing some research, there could be some applications that could be downloaded used in Windows, but nothing built in like automator and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Services_menu">services</a>.</p>

<p>There have been several times that <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/">Mac Power Users</a> has talked about automator, but specifically <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/2012/01/22/mpu-070-working-with-automator/">MPU 070: Working with Automator</a>.  Its good, and a great Podcast if your interested.</p>

<p>Another application that I have been loving has been <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a>.  For some reason, with all of my popup select features (I think it's because I'm syncing it with <a href="http://www.phraseexpress.com/">Phrase Express</a> on Windows).  I created a service which uses an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript">AppleScript</a> which searches copied text for the "|" and replaces it with ":" a pretty simple apple script is below (Its probably not very efficient, but it's my first one.</p>

<pre><code>on replace_chars(this_text, search_string, replacement_string)
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to the search_string
    set the item_list to every text item of this_text
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to the replacement_string
    set this_text to the item_list as string
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ""
    return this_text
end replace_chars


set the message_text to get the clipboard
set the message_text to replace_chars(message_text, "|", ":")

return message_text
</code></pre>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>From Surreal to Real</title>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_12349">The last days before heading out on this adventure of a lifetime (see post: <a href="/blog/2009/7/let-the-world-change-you-and-you-can-change-the-world" data-cke-saved-href="/blog/2009/7/let-the-world-change-you-and-you-can-change-the-world" target="_blank">Let The World Change You, and... You Can Change The World</a> for more information on my trip) I had a lot of different feelings and thoughts. You can also see my photo's I uploaded of my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.524662924576.2042125.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=0b0541d620" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.524662924576.2042125.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=0b0541d620" target="_blank">End of Summer Adventures Facebook Albums</a>. It felt very surreal to know that i was leaving for a long period of time. Spending some last day's hanging out with friends, it felt like I would be able to see them again anytime that I wanted… just like I always have been able to. When I gave back my apartment, I had a realization that I was then homeless. Hanging out with my mom before I left, I went on my way feeling like I haven't spent enough time with her during the last couple of years.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_12352">The closer I got to the trip, getting inside the airplane… landing in Dallas then in Miami… then in Trinidad it all became very real.<br></p><h2 id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_14259">The Miami Heat</h2><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_12361">You can view the album <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.524870059476.2042340.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=aeab88d4ed" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.524870059476.2042340.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=aeab88d4ed" target="_blank">Miami Heat in the Evening and Trinidad CoExisting Island Style Facebok Album</a>&nbsp;if you are interested in seeing the pictures.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_12364">So I guess that I ought to explain a little bit of what's happened so far in the last couple of days, so that you can keep up. We had a 12 hour layover in Miami, which was planned to be that way. While it was supper hot outside, it didn't start out so hot. We took forever to figure out the bus system, missed the last night bus (at 12:30… doesn't make sense). We ended up paying for a taxi ($32.00) to go to <a href="http://g.co/maps/npvh3" data-cke-saved-href="http://g.co/maps/npvh3" target="_blank">Miami Beach</a>. It was a lot of fun, and worth all of the hardship. We salsa danced at <a href="http://www.mangostropicalcafe.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.mangostropicalcafe.com/" target="_blank">Mango's Tropical Cafe</a>&nbsp;for a couple of hours. We spent some time at <a href="http://www.clevelander.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.clevelander.com/" target="_blank">The Clevelander</a>, a pretty cool club. We ended up wondering down to the beach and just playing in the water and talking about life, love, and God for a couple of hours. It was really great, and made me so glad that I was going with Ami. I could tell it would be a great trip. Around about 6am, it was getting late enough that we could catch a bus back to the airport. We first caught the one going the wrong way, then we ended up missing the next one. While we were waiting for the one after that, we got the great idea into our heads that we should sneak onto a yacht and do some exploring. Well, we missed the next bus due to that. So when we finally got back to the airport around 8am, combining jet lag and lack of sleep we were both exhausted. After three and a half more hours we were in Trinidad.<br></p><h2 id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_16030">Co-Existing Island Style -- Trinidad &amp; Tobago<br></h2>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390103596855_12705">We arrived in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago" data-cke-saved-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago" target="_blank">Trinidad</a> and encountered a couple of problems right away. First they didn't want to let us into the country because we didn't have a specific place we were staying and we didn't have a specific plan for leaving. In hindsight, I believe that this is important. We took a taxi to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Spain" data-cke-saved-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Spain" target="_blank">Port of Spain</a>, the city we are staying at in Trinidad. It poured rain on and off the first night. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ami.mcbride" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/ami.mcbride" target="_blank">Ami</a> and I were so tired that we both went to sleep around 6 or 7pm. The next morning, we woke up early. We met a couple of different people. First was Chester, who wondered around with us trying to help us find a restaurant. We ended up buying him a soda. Later we met Marcus, who we ended up paying about $15.00 for his service as a "certified tour guide." Although we probably got swindled a bit, it was worth it to get to see the sights. One place that was really interesting was the Reggae club he took us to. It was pretty eclectic, locked people inside of this bar, and everybody was smoking marijuana. That night we ended up going out to see what the night life was. We ended up meeting a guy named Steven. He was totally enamored with Ami, and had no problem telling her that, after he found out that we weren't together. Today, I slept in much later than Ami did. We wondered out looking for a meal, and then spent hours agonizing over how to get off of this expensive island. When we decided to just follow the plan we had made the day before (wait till Wednesday and take a ferry to Venezuela) , we walked down to Independence Square. It's was pretty amazing to see how many people were out. It was full of the eclectic groups of people that make up Trinidad. From business men, families, Rastafarians, homeless, and everything in between. It was awesome to see so many people outside, enjoying community, parks, and the early evening. All and all, even though it's become very real. I'm very excited to see what happens during this trip.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Tri-Cities Wine Festival</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/11/tri-cities-wine-festival</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last couple of weeks have been pretty great. This last weekend was really fun. I got the opportunity to go to the 2010 Tri-Cities Wine Festival held at the <a href="http://www.threeriversconventioncenter.com/" title="Three Rivers Convention Center">Three Rivers Convention Center</a>. It was a really fabulous event. While the entrance was generally $65.00 to attend, I was able to get in for free. <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org/" title="Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery">Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery</a> was invited to the event to do a coat check for donations. I was able to go and spend a little bit of time tasting some wines before starting to collect coats. It was a lot of fun. When I was walking around (by myself at first), I ended up meeting two people. One was a lady from China who had gotten her Ph.D. from <a href="http://wsu.edu/" title="Washington State University">WSU</a> and a guy who was from Chile. I was really surprised to meet a couple of international persons in the Tri-Cities (I always feel like it's such a small place). Especially the guy from Chile. We spent time talking about Pisco, and the rivalry between Peru and Chile. It was very interesting.</p>

<p>When I was doing the coat check it was kind of fun. I got to talk about Safe Harbor with a number of people and hear lots of people say they were familiar with our services. We even had a guy give a $100 donation into our tip jar. Pretty phenomenal.</p>

<p>I get to go into my orientation here tomorrow for Tri-Cities Community Health. It seems like things are getting into place.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Almost a Year and Wanting to Escape</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RS-Q7dSR14c?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
 
<p>A video I made in <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/imovie/">iMovie</a> from my <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone">iPhone 5</a> Video Camera.  It uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Away_(Lenny_Kravitz_song">Lenny Kravitz Fly Away</a>) for the music and features Mateo trying to escape from our home.</p>

<p>After taking Mateo's 10 moth pictures, I filed this movie and edited it with iMovie.  It was kind of fun, and didn't take more then a couple of hours.  The Monthly Photo Project has been kind of a fun project and we are getting close to the tail end of it.</p>

      <title>Corrupt Police, Pickpockets, and Broken Computers</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/7/corrupt-police-pickpockets-and-broken-computers</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems I only <a href="/blog/2010/4/mi-vida-loca" title="Mi Vida Loca">write when there is crazy stuff happening in my life</a>… please don't think that my life is so full of these crazy experiences.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this I had to travel to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arica" title="Arica Chile Wikipedia Article">Arica Chile</a> to renew my passport. I took a bus from Cusco to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arequipa" title="Wikipeida article on Arequipa Peru">Arequipa</a> (about 10 hours) and then another bus to Tacna Peru. Tacna is the border town between Peru and Chile. When we were outside of the city we passed a police checkpoint. They often enter buses and check peoples identification. I was past due on my visa, by about eight days. They told me that I needed to come into their station and talk to them because my visa was past due. They search all my belongings, and kept telling me in Spanish that I was going to get deported for being past due on my visa. They asked me to help them purchase a new book for the police station. They said that it costs S/. 150.00 (about $55.00). If I "helped them" they would "help me". I knew that when I got to the border I would have to pay $1 per day that I was overdue on my visa. I took their bluff and refused to give them any money. They kept telling me that I wouldn't ever be able to come back to Peru and that it didn't matter that I had an apartment and and my belongings in Cusco. I still refused to pay them any money.</p>

<p>I must say to make this situation worse, I had a lot of cash in my possession. I don't like to carry a lot of cash because it's not safe in Peru. I had just received my paycheck and did not have time to cash it before leaving Cusco. I had my entire paycheck, a little over S/. 1200.00 (about $400.00). But when I have more cash, I also put some money in my wallet and some in my bag… in case I get robbed or something.</p>

<p>When the police were talking to me they kept moving me from room to room leaving my bag in another room. During one of these times, they must have taken S/. 100.00 (about $35.00). They also took my 4 gig iPod nano (although I didn't notice this until I reached Arica). They finally just let me go. I also ended up paying them S/. 10.00 to be able to leave. I also didn't realize until later that they had stolen the money. I just figured it would get them off my back and buy them a beer or something.</p>

<p>I spent the night in Arica and when I was returning I was afraid of the police bothering me again and trying to take more of my money. I decided to put all of my salary in my wallet. I fell asleep on the bus and when I arrived at the terminal in Arequipa went down to wait for my backpack from under the bus. I felt somebody hit my little backpack and moved it to the front for fear of pickpockets. I guess I was just tired and didn't think about having my wallet in my back pocket too. So stupid! Well, they weren't going for my backpack like I thought. They went for my wallet. Went into the station to purchase a ticket for Cusco and found that my wallet was gone. Luckily I had some change. I called a co-worker to work for me int he morning and took a taxi to a hostel. I had to call a friend in the US to wire me some money the next morning so I could get back to Cusco. It was a pretty sucky experience and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone.</p>

<p>I found that I could live for pretty cheaply. While I haven't paid for my rent yet, I've been able to live most of this month for about $100. I know in Peru 18.5 percent of the population lives on less than $2 a day. I'm not sure how they do it. I guess, even being very poor for a month, I still have my western ideals of my lifestyle.</p>

<p>I figured with this event, I lose my status as a Piña (Spanish for pinapple a slang in Cusco for unlucky) and become a Lechero (Spanish for milk man a slang in Cusco for a lucky person). I think it's going that way. But lately, I've been having some troubles with my computer. It's been shutting off randomly, I think because it's overheating. I guess I am a bit of a Lechero because I still have it under warranty. But it means that I'm going to be without my computer for a while. I think my house is going to be quite for a while.</p>

<p>Also, if you haven't checked out my website for a while, check out the <a href="/home" title="Jacob Campbell's main page">main page</a>. I've been transiting to using a CSM (<a href="http://drupal.org/" title="Drupal Offical Page">Drupal</a>). Let me know what you think.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>My adventures in South America seem to be coming to a close, at least of now (hopefully I'll be back in a couple of years after paying off my student loans). It's been a wonderful trip. While I've been living in Cusco, I've been building up a bit of a movie collection of movies. DVD's are super expensive in the US, but here I can buy a DVD for S/. 2.00 (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=2+PEN+TO+USD&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">about $0.72</a>). The latest addition to my collection has been the three original Indiana Jones moves. Watching <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082971/">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>&nbsp;made me think about my adventures here. While I haven't found any lost Inca artifacts, I have had lots of interesting experiences.</p><p>This said, it's time for me to return to the US. I still don't know what I'll be doing or where I'll be living, I've been working on that some. I've been looking for jobs online hoping to make my transition back to the US as easy as possible. I've also been spending considerable time updating my <a href="/home">website</a>. I've changed the complete format and I'm getting much more satisfied with how everything looks aesthetically.</p><p>I have a bus ticket for Thursday (09/09/10) from Cusco to Lima. While I'm not looking forward to the 24 hour bus ride, hopefully there won't be any protests. On Sunday the 12th I fly from Lima to Las Vegas. I'll be spending 5 days in Vegas. There's a really great airlines that flies to Vegas for really cheap. On <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allegiantair.com/aaVegasDestinations.php">Allegiant Air</a>&nbsp;you can fly to from Vegas to Pasco for like $25. It's really a beautiful thing. The only problem is that they don't fly everyday. I'll have to wait for five days. I'm planning on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/">Couch Surfing</a>&nbsp;while I'm there so it shouldn't be too expensive. And while it would be fun to visit all of the casinos and see the shows, I'm pretty sure that I won't have money for that. That means on Friday the 17th, I'll be back in the Tri-Cities. I plan on visiting (moving back to...) Spokane soon, so you can all look forward to that.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Creative Giving?</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/10/creative-giving</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think that creativity and ideas are everywhere for us, we just have to tap into them. It also seems that it is easy to come up with ideas about things to spend money on, when one doesn't have any money to spend.</p>

<p>I went to McDonald's tonight for a snack, kind of a long story, and spent some of the last couple of dollars I have on some McChicken Sandwiches. This got me thinking about how their only a buck. Buying two of them was sufficient for my stomach (probably not if I was super hungry...). This got me thinking about what if I just bought like 100 of them (or 50) and gave them out to homeless people (although this would probably work better in Spokane then here in the Tri-Cities).</p>

<p>I am a firm believer in giving. I think it is a great thing, and even though I've never made a lot of money working, I've always given. This is normally my tithe, and I've given to various organizations, and given lots of my time. I think it would be cool to, after I get a job probably, put into my budget a "Creative Giving" category. On my budget I generally take out 20% of my gross income. I pay myself first with 10% and tithe 10%. Then I've in the past had some different things that I've given to with some extra money.</p>

<p>If I could have this "Creative Giving" category, and maybe only put $50 into it every month. I would want to require that I come up with a new creative way to give away that money every month. It seems to be a really interesting idea, but probably not worth that much coming from somebody who had to gather change to pay a $2.17 late night dinner at McDonald's, we'll have to see if when I have an income I put my money where my mouth is.</p>

<p>I want to know, if someone gave you $50 and told you that you had to come up with a creative idea on how to give it away.... what would you do with it?</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>A Quick Recap</h2><p>In just about a month, I will have been in South America for an entire year. Before leaving on this epic adventure, I remember sitting with Ami and watching the quoted <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318462/">movie</a> above. It's a really great movie about 'El Che' and his motorcycle trip around South America. He and his friend traveled around South America, the tagline of the movie "Let the world change you... and you can change the world." 'El Che' later became a revolutionary leader helping to free a number of South American Countries. When I left I was hoping for a similar type of experience. I left the US, put my loans on hold for a year and sought to find myself while in South America. I think I have seen a lot of things and a lot that I've learned. I've also improved my Spanish immensely, although I've been told that I speak pretty fluent Spanish it's been equated to speaking Spanish like Tarzan speaks English.</p><p>As I have been down in South America (Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, Brazil, and Peru) I've had both really great experiences and difficult experiences. I've seen some of the most beautiful places that I've seen anywhere else in the world, but I've also seen some horrible destruction of the environment that we all love and need. I've meet some of the most friendly and hospitable people but it has been contrasted with some people on the opposite end of the spectrum. I've seen abject poverty. I've seen fighting, been robbed (4 times), been asked to give a bribe to public officals, and other social problems. Even with all of this I still absolutely love it here in South America and am in love with the people and culture here.</p><h2>Recent Events</h2><p>During the last nine months, I have been living and working in Cusco Peru. I've been working at the National University (UNSAAC) teaching English. I spent some time volunteering at a NGO and had desired to find a job doing social work. As it has grown closer to the time to return to the US, I have stopped looking for a job doing social work because of my feeling that my Spanish is not sufficient to practice my trade here. So I have limited myself to just working at the University.</p><p>For the first couple of months I was working at the University, I didn't have a contract. But for the last seven months or so, I have been working under a contract given by the University. Although, I haven't had a work visa during my time here I felt that it was not necessary. It is very common for foreign teachers to teach at the various language center without work visas (In Cusco, due to all the tourism, there are lots of English language schools). I do believe that it is kind of illegal to work without a work visa, but when I read the law it seemed to be permissible depending on the agents discretion. Furthermore, every month the University pays taxes to SUNAT under the description of foreigner workers. I actually have been paying more taxes then is normal for a Peruvian worker. The normal tax rate is 15%, but I've been paying 25%. With all of this, I felt safe not applying for a work visa. To obtain a work visa (I believe with all the fees and process) it would cost somewhere between $300-$400 (about my monthly income). It would also take several months to complete the process and require the University give me a yearlong contract (which they generally only give 6 month contracts). So I decided not to pursue that avenue.</p><p>On the previous Friday (08/06/10) the immigration police came to the University looking for teachers without work visa. Two of my colleagues were taken from their classes. While I was not found at the University, they had my name and gave me an announcement of a meeting with the immigration police. It was originally scheduled for Saturday, but when I went in on Saturday they rescheduled for Monday. Monday they rescheduled for Wednesday so I continued to work. On Wednesday I again went in and was finally questioned and asked to sign some documents. Currently I'm under custody of my friend and am not allowed to either leave the city or work until the end of the investigation. The charges are not criminal, they are only administrative (meaning that I can't go to jail or be deported)... they can only give me a fine and or tell me that I need to leave the country prior to the expiration of my visa.</p><h2>Future Plans</h2><p>It has been a very interesting experience so far. They told me that the investigation can take from two or three weeks to two months. (although I am a bit worried that could mean more then two months). My plan is to return to the US when the investigation is finished. I am hoping that the investigation does not take too long. If I'm allowed to leave the country by the beginning of September I should be financially able to handle everything (depending on how grave the possible fine will be). But if I do have to say in Cusco for a couple of months, I will have some difficulties financially. I currently have money to purchase a plane ticket back home, but I have been living off of the money that I earn at the University to survive daily. To make matters a little worse, due to one of the times I was robbed, I no longer have my debit card or access to my bank account. I have been waiting for the last month to receive my new debit card... but I'm not sure if it is coming and I might have to order it again.</p><p>It is possible that due to these circumstance, I might ask sometime in the future if you, my friends, would be willing to offer me a slight amount of financial support. I have another meeting on Monday with the police and it is possible that things will be resolved by then but I'm not sure. As of right now, I'm am perfectly fine... so don't worry. I just wanted to let you guy's all know what is happening in my life. I'll keep everybody posted about what is happening down here.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 id="outofperubacktotheus">Out of Peru &amp; Back to the US</h2>

<p>After being in Cusco for about a year, it was really sad to leave. I remember being on the bus and waving goodbye and starting to tear up a bit. Then as the bus road off into the sun set, I was struck by the beauty of it and the symbolism. It's as if a chapter in my life was setting at the same time as the sun. I took the almost 24 hour bus ride to the center of Lima, and called the person I'd be Couchsurfing with. After taking a taxi ride to meet him, we went back to his place to drop my stuff off. We then went to Miraflores, where I finished all of my last minute shopping.</p>

<p>That night we went to one of his friends houses, and celebrated their birthday with them. It was pretty fun, although we didn't get back to his place until super early in the morning. The next day, I spent walking around Lima. Found a Pollo a la Brasa (Roasted Chicken and French Fries) place and ate my last Peruvian meal (I could't decide... my favorites are Pollo a la Brasa, Ceviche, and Chicharron). I met up with a friend I met when I was traveling and we walked around the main plaza for a while. Then I went to a super market and spent the rest of my money to have a packed lunch / breakfast the next morning. I left with just enough money for a taxi to the Airport and to pay the airport tax (S/. 88.00).</p>

<p>Five thirty the next morning I was off. Flew to Ft. Lauderdale and had a four hour layover, and then to Vegas. I was flying by Spiritair (a really cheap airlines) but they don't provide meals. By the end of the day I was so hungry (I got to Vegas at 12:30am the next morning Lima time) and I had only eaten my two sandwiches and chips all day. I had absolutely no money (well S/. 4.40 in my pocket, but nobody would exchange it) and had to spend the night in the airport.</p>

<p>The next morning, tired, mostly unslept, and hungry I left the airport in search of my Bank. When I started walking, a guy told me that I couldn't walk to my bank from the airport (too far and no sidewalks) and just gave me enough money for a bus ride. I found my bank, but realized I left way too early. So I waited on the steps for about two hours until they opened and I cleared out my account. After some breakfast and coffee and internet, I found my hostel (I was planning on Couchsurfing, but nobody responded). I had to wait a couple of hours for my room to be opened.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, i walked down to the strip and from one end to the other. This doesn't seem like very much but with combined with entering the hotels and looking at the casinos it was probably about 4 or 5 miles. I took a bus back to the hotel (the buses are super expensive, but nice here). You can check out my photo album, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2064741&amp;id=44504407&amp;l=51566365c6">Vegas Baby</a> on Facebook. Other than that, my computer is dying and it's time to head back to my hostel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I've heard about people who live outside of New York and other metropolitan areas having to commute for two hours each way. According to <a href="https://www.census.gov/hhes/commuting/data/commuting.html">US Census Bureau 2011 Report</a> the average commute time in the United states is 25.5 minutes. That number is fairly skewed because it incorporates persons who work at home (with no commute) and persons who don't work at home. They found that amend workers who do not work at home, 8.1 percent had a commute of 60 minutes or longer and that a majority of those tend to drive alone. <a href="http://www.wnyc.org">WNYC</a> has a pretty cool interactive map that you can look at average commute times.</p><iframe src="http://project.wnyc.org/commute-times-us/embed.html?layer=0#5.00/42.000/-89.500" height="690" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>Last year, when I was commuting from Prosser to Tri-Cities for work, about a 45 minute trip there and the same coming back.  I found that having such a lengthy trip to get back and forth to work to be extremely burdensome. I would get back home, and just be so tired, not wanting to do anything. It did have some benefits as well. It gave me time to decompress about my day. It also started a new habit for me, listening to Podcasts.</p><p>I grew up listening to talk radio and books on tape with my mom for years. I really love <a href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a> and have talked about <a href="https://jacob-campbell.squarespace.com/blog/?tag=National+Public+Radio">National Public Radio on my blog a number of times</a>. When I started doing my commute, I ended up starting to listen to podcasts, and I really fell in love. There are so many topics and possible options. The following are what I've been listening to.</p><hr />

<p>This is by far my favorite podcast, and I've written about them <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/?tag=Mac+Power+Users">a number of times</a>. If you are a mac / apple product users, I would highly recommend it no matter what your expertise level is. I have learned so much, and I have improved my productivity with their content so much I absolutely love it. I've even been talked about on one of their episodes, in <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2014/1/podcast-famous-shout-out-on-mac-power-users">Podcast Famous</a>. They are a large part of the reason I decided to go to Macworld / iWorld 2014 this year, and I even met <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2014/3/the-first-look-conference-beginnings-and-sights">them there</a>. All of the other podcasts on the 5by5 Network that I listen to, are because I first heard their guests on MPU.</p><hr />

<h2 id="backtowork5podcastinitunes6"><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to Work</a> -- <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/back-to-work/id415535037?partnerId=30&amp;siteID=GfpxbBXXpXE-y3gfJGyOQcSr2tOpkzD12A">Podcast in iTunes</a></h2><p>While, I don't think that I've posted anything on my website regarding Back to Work or Merlin Mann, I look forward to this show so much every week. While I'm not really a comic book fan (and sometimes I just don't pay attention when they talk about them), I absolutely love their show. This is one of the few podcasts that Minnie is willing to listen too, and she actually thinks some of it is funny. They talk about productivity, communication, work, barriers, constraints, tools, and more. I have learned a ton. The fact that my workflow has changed, and that I've somewhat incorporated David Allen's Getting Things Done (don't worry, I will do a <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/?tag=Book+Review">book review</a> sometime soon regarding his book) is due to Merlin Mann and Back to Work. While they do sometimes talk about technology, they don't always so even if your not a tech nerd, I'd highly recommend this show.</p><hr />

While I haven't read any of the books yet, I am hoping to. Every week they come out with interesting topics, things that just peak my interest and make me want to learn more. The way that they describe it, is that they talk about the hidden side of everything. This is one of those shows that I listen to, and I come away and feel like I'm just smarter. It's great, and even Minnie really likes it.</p><hr />

They have professors, doctors, business leaders. Unlike many of the other Podcasts that I listen to, they tend to keep their shows close to a half hour, so you can almost always fit it in in one listening. Even the guests and topics that I don't think I would care very much about end up being really interesting. Much of the show is about finding your passions and being a creator of stuff. It's pretty interesting and great guests.</p><hr />

This one is fun. I even got to meet them and go to a private party when I was in San Francisco. It tends to be mostly news and rumors regarding apple products. I wouldn't recommend it for everybody, but it makes me laugh and has some interesting topics.</p><hr />

I use so many of the great things that he has created and put together. The software he has written and scripts that I've been able to download makes everything on my mac so much better. His podcast is another interview style show. He talks to all kind of people do all kinds of jobs (although a lot of them tend to in the computer sciences). It's always interesting to hear about how people do their work, what they are excited about, and what their lives look like. There does tend to be a lot of discussion regarding technology, especially apple products / apps, but it's really good stuff.</p><hr />

It's pretty good information. I've been going through his back catalogue. He doesn't post on a schedule, but it seems to be about monthly, but not set schedule. I decided that because I had so many technology focused podcasts, I needed to find something that could keep me up to date regarding my day job too. I looked at a couple, and this was the best one I found. If you your a social worker, or in a counseling related field, it's pretty good with some really high profile guests and a wide range of topics.</p><hr />]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Other then the job hunt, I've been spending some time online working on my website. Well, actually (not consistently) for the last several weeks I've been trying to figure out one thing. Not even a very important thing, but something that I wanted done. Basically I wanted to make it so that when I write a blog post, I can enter where I wrote it from. Then I wanted this to display on the right sidebar. Well, after too much work... I finally got it. Not to maybe go back through and put the data into all my older posts. But enjoy knowing where I wrote my posts from it only took lots of hours to make it all possible.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Mateo the Old Man: DIY Old Man Halloween Costume</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1024.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/527f60b7e4b02175815fb8df/1384079553089/Mateo+the+Old+Man%3A+DIY+Old+Man+Halloween+Costume.png" alt=" Mateo the Old Man: DIY Old Man Halloween Costume "/>  Mateo the Old Man: DIY Old Man Halloween Costume [/caption] 
  

<p>I spent the last couple of weeks searching in google images for the perfect costume for Mateo's first halloween costume.  I found a great idea, dress Mateo up like an old man.  I ended up coming across, [Best Toddler Costume: Carl from “Up”] (http://www.geekinheels.com/2011/11/10/best-toddler-costume-carl-from-up.html).  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/">UP (2009)</a> is a fantastic movie.  While Mateo's costume, wasn't meant to imitate Carl like the aforementioned link, we decided on just an old man.</p>

<p>You can see some of photos I took of Mateo and the putting the walker together below.  We ended up doing our photo shoot with Mateo this weekend (a week after halloween).  Mateo wasn't having any pictures the day of.  You can also see the album, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.815629415396&amp;type=1&amp;l=becece9307">Old Man Mateo, Halloween 2013</a>.</p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

      <title>Speaking of Speaking, a Busy Week</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/11/speaking-of-speaking-a-busy-week</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This last week has been incredibly busy for me, but it's also been very good.  On Tuesday I had two major speaking activities to prepare for.  At work, <a href="http://www.mytcch.org/behavioral.php">Tri-Cities Community Health Behavioral Health Services</a>, we are starting a group on <a href="http://www.loveandlogic.com/">Becoming Parents with Love and Logic</a>.  We haven't done groups for a while, and I've never facilitated this course before, so I spent most of the weekend getting ready for the group.  It went really well.  That evening I had another event I was speaking at.</p>

<p>Almost a year ago, I transitioned to using a mac.  A couple of months ago, i found out about these things called <a href="https://www.apple.com/usergroups/">mac user groups</a>.  It's kind of geeky, but it has been kind of cool.  <a href="http://www.macusergroup.com">The Mid Columbia Macintosh User Group</a> meets in Kennewick.  I've been very lucky to speak at a lot of events, regarding a lot of topics.  This was the first time that I've been able to talk to about technology stuff.  I'm hoping to have more opportunities in the future.  You can download a copy my <a href="/s/brief-overview-alfred-keynotekey.zip">Overview of Alfred Keynote</a> from my presentation or see it below.</p>

<p>On Thursday the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pascodiscoverycoalition/">Pasco Discovery Coalition</a> did a Town Hall and Resource Fair Event at Ochoa Middle School.  It was pretty great.  We had about 37 different community organizations!  It was fun to prepare for and to put on.  You can download a copy of the<a href="/s/pasco-discovery-coalition-town-hall-keynote-2013key.zip"> PDC Town Hall 2003 Keynote</a> from my presentation or see it below.  You can also see the various photos uploaded to the <a href="http://fb.com/pascodiscoverycoalition">Pasco Discovery Coalition's Facebook</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.519838581445710.1073741828.449212268508342&amp;type=1&amp;l=68897e3b2f">Town Hall &amp; Resource Fair 2013</a>.</p>

<p>Tonight is Safe Harbor Crisis Nursery's <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org/index.php/latest-news/25-beggars-banquet-2013">Beggars Banquet</a>.  Work has been absolutely beyond crazy busy for me, so it's been a pretty crazy week.  We decided not to go tonight, which is too bad, because it would have been a great event.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Job Hunt Continues</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/10/the-job-hunt-continues</link>

As I've been back in the US, I've been looking for a job. I feel kind of like Elmer Fudd and never finding my wabit    [/caption] 
  

<p>Since I've been back in the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-Cities,_Washington">Tri-Cities</a>, I've been up to quite a bit. Mainly I've been focused on looking for a job, which the job search is always exciting. I've had some luck. I have my first interview scheduled for Thursday. It's at Nueva Esperanza Counseling Center in Pasco (a division of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mytcch.org/">Community Health Center: La Clinica</a>). I would be a Counseling Case Manager. It sounds like the job would be working at a detox center.</p><p>I've put my application in maybe eight or 10 places so far. One place that seems to have a lot of hope would be at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.esd123.org/">Educational Service District 1 2 3</a>. I have a friend that works for the Pasco School district who has been talking to their director on my behalf, which is a really sweet deal. You know what they say, sometimes it's not what you know, it's who you know. I think in my case, I have both going for me. I would be a prevention / intervention specialist for middle school students. It would be a great job, and I'd probably be able to work with what my friend just called little "thuglettes."</p><p>The other place of note that I've applied for (well, in the process) is for <a target="_blank" href="http://dshs.wa.gov">DSHS</a>. Actually I'm applying for a couple of jobs there. One that would be cool is working with low-income / homeless people. It would be a bit stretching, because it's mainly with the elderly. But I have really enjoyed doing work with the homeless, so that would be really cool. I also like the possibility of it's a regional job, so I believe I'd be traveling all over Eastern Washington. This means that I could probably see my friends from all over too. Plus the job pays really really well, like just under $5,000 to just under $6,000 a month. I was talking to my mom, and she's never had a job that paid that much before. I think I could pay off my student loans pretty quick if I was doing that.</p><p>I've been putting my application in all over (I've mainly been looking right now in Tri-Cities, because I have a pretty sweet possible rent deal for a 2 bedroom house for only $200 per month or so) but also plan to look in Portland, and Spokane... and wherever else I can find a job. Other than the job hunt, I've been trying to see some old friends. A year is a long time to be away. If I haven't gotten the chance to hang out with you yet, give me a call. I have the same number. It's nothing personal, I've just been focused on job hunting. Figure I need to have some money coming in. Speaking of which, I went and donated plasma for the first time in several years! It's only $30, but when you have no money it's a lot.</p><p>I've also have been playing around with my computer. I created my first theme for my BlackBerry. It was made really quickly (in like 30 minutes or so), but I'm in process of making what will hopefully be a really cool one. When I finish, I'll post it (maybe I'll even sell it for like $00.99...).&nbsp;</p><p>Like I said, if I haven't had the chance to hang out with you... give me a call or wait around a bit and I'll get around to calling you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Quick Happy Birthday Graphic</title>

<p>Not going to be a long post, just a quick graphic I put together for Minnie's Birthday. She really likes <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fxnetworks.com/soa">Sons of Anarchy</a>, so I figured that theme would be fun (even if it is a day late). I found the picture on <a target="_blank" href="http://nwhog.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/harley-davidson-out-bmwing-bmw/">Northwest Harley Blog</a> and used the magic healing brush to erase the writing. I used the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dafont.com/carnevalee-freakshow.font?nb_ppp=50&amp;text=SONS+OF+ANARCHY">Carnevalee Freak Font</a> to try to match the Son's of Anarchy Font with applied shadow and stroke. The <a target="_blank" href="http://news.toyark.com/2013/12/12/mezco-produce-sons-anarchy-collectible-products-109665">SOA Logo</a> was taken from one of lots on the internet with the background deleted and a circular shape with opacity placed behind it to help it stand out (and some other blending options). If you're interested, you can download the <a href="/s/happy-birthday-old-lady-sons-anarchy-graphic.psd">photoshop file</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Now Open, New Small Business Owner</title>

<p>If you know me very well you know I have a lot of stuff I'm invovled with.  Sometimes feel a little bit like I'm <a href="http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/erich-brenn-plate-spinner">Erich Brenn</a>, and I'm trying to keep all of my plates spinning.  The following is the short list of plates I've got in the air right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Being a new dad / family (so much fun, but tiring too)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mytcch.org/">Tri-Cities Community Health</a> (my day job)</li>
<li>Teaching at <a href="http://www.heritage.edu">Heritage University</a></li>
<li>Acting as the chair person for the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pascodiscoverycoalition/">Pasco Discovery Coalition</a> (like us on <a href="http://fb.com/PascoDiscoveryCoalition">Facebook</a></li>
<li>Being involved at our <a href="http://eastlaketricities.com">church</a></li>
<li>Various volunteer and community activities that come up, especially at <a href="http://crisis-nursery.org">Safe Harbor</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/my.friends.place.kennewick">My Friends Place</a></li>
<li>Attending and <a href="https://jacob-campbell.squarespace.com/blog/2013/11/speaking-of-speaking-a-busy-week">speaking</a> at the <a href="http://www.macusergroup.com">MC Mac User Group</a></li>
<li>I'm working on getting my LICSW, hopefully by the end of next year... maybe then doing a small amount of private practice work.</li>
<li>Being a geek and reading, playing with all things technology and productivity related</li>
<li>I'd still like to write my book, and have made some limited progress</li>
<li>Being social, spending time with family and friends</li>
</ul>

<p>With all of these plates spinning, I figured it was time that I take my extra curricular activities to the next level.  I applied and was approved today for a <a href="http://bls.dor.wa.gov/LicenseSearch/lqsLicenseDetail.aspx?RefID=334735">small business license for the state of Washington</a>.  It's starting as a sole proprietor ownership style, and I am calling it <strong>Locus of Transformation</strong>.  The plan is to also get licensed in the City of Pasco, so I'm hopping to take in my application tomorrow sometime.  I do have some plans and hopes for this currently, but I'm not really ready to share those yet.  I'm am sure that it is something that will be also evolving over time, and I'm very sure I'll be sharing more as things progress.  I chose the name, because I feel like all of the different activities, organization, and people I even work with individually I really desire to be a point of change.</p>

<p>So, while I don't have anything currently going yet, and defiantly not any revenue streams yet... I am officially a small business owner.  I did make a logo.  It's still a work in progress, but I figure it's a good start.  I'd love any feedback.</p>

      <title>Which Style?</title>
      <link>/blog/2010/9/which-style</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey, just looking for some feedback. which style do you think is better for my business cards. My old card has my photo, and is more relaxed. I was thinking that maybe it was time to change up and have my business card match my website / letterhead / resume... etc. I know that most people don't have all of these things, but I guess I am a very special person (it's even on my birth certificate). So whether your reading this on my website or my Facebook, let me know which style you thing is better or if you have any comments about the design let me know (good / bad / whatever is appreciated)</p>

      <title>My 2013 Christmas Wish List</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/12/my-2013-christmas-wish-list</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mainly am making a christmas wish list on here for my family, so that they can see some of the things I would be happy to receive for Christmas.  I am by no means expecting all of these items (or even a quarter of them) or considering this a comprehensive list of the things that I want.  It was more kind of fun to go through and make.  It's not necessarily in any particular order either.  Some of my ideas are way to expensive, and some of them are actually cheap enough that a random friend could buy them (although I'm not expecting that).</p>

<h1 id="technologyrelated">Technology Related</h1>

<p>I am really a geek at heart, and anybody who knows me, knows that I love technology.  The following are some stuff that seem pretty cool.  You should also listen to the <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/2013/11/24/mac-power-users-165-2013-geek-gift-guide/">Mac Power Users 2013 Geek Gift Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fitbitforce">FitBit Force</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/force">FitBit Force</a> is a pretty cool piece of wearable technology.  A powerful Force for everyday fitness, this sleek wristband is with you all the time. Stay motivated to keep moving with real-time stats right on your wrist. Track steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, stairs climbed and active minutes throughout the day. At night, track your sleep and wake up silently with a vibrating alarm.</p>

<h2 id="ariawifiscale">Aria Wi-Fi Scale</h2>

<p>I've thought that having a wireless scale would be cool for a couple of years now.  I'm not really sure which one would be better, but I figure If I already go with the FitBit, then I should go with their scale.  Get where you want to be. Aria™ tracks your weight, body fat percentage, and BMI, painting a picture of your long-term progress. It wirelessly syncs your stats with online graph and mobile tools that help you stay motivated and on track. When you're in control, stepping on the scale feels good.</p>

<h2 id="thecoin">The Coin</h2>

<p><a href="https://onlycoin.com">The Coin</a> isn't out yet, but it does seem super cool.  It is a card that let you put your other cards digitally onto it.  I currently have two debit cards and credit card.  While it's not too cumbersome to have to carry all of these cards, it would be cool to just need one.</p>

<h2 id="appleipadair">Apple iPad Air</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-air/">Apple iPad Air</a>... not much else to say.  Pretty amazing.  I'm hoping to upgrade next year probably.</p>

<h2 id="scansnapscanner">ScanSnap Scanner</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/us/services/computing/peripherals/scanners/scansnap/s1300i.html">Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300i</a>.  I'd like to become paperless.</p>

<h2 id="filetransporter">File Transporter</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.filetransporter.com/learn-more/">File Transporter</a> is pretty amazing.  It lets you set up your own personal cloud.</p>

<h2 id="speakersfortv">Speakers for TV</h2>

<p>I'm not sure what brand we'd like, but having a sound bar would be a great improvement for our TV watching, kid sing-along listening pleasure.</p>

<h2 id="previousgenerationairportextreme">Previous Generation AirPort Extreme</h2>

<p>I'm hoping to eventually have a couple of these along with speakers around the home so that I can stream music  to them from anywhere.  The new ones are $100 right now, but I think you can get the previous generation ones off of eBay / Craigslist for $30 or $40.</p>

<h2 id="thenestthermostat">The Nest Thermostat</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://nest.com/thermostat/life-with-nest-thermostat/">Nest</a> is pretty cool.  I'd love to be able to turn on / off our central air from anywhere.  Getting home from work, don't want the house to be cold... such a great idea.</p>

<h1 id="homesupplies">Home Supplies</h1>

<h2 id="patioheater">Patio Heater</h2>

<p>I like to be outside, even during winter.  This is kind of crazy with how cold it is.  A Patio Heater would be a great idea.</p>

<h2 id="fireplacescreen">Fireplace Screen</h2>

<p>Our fireplace doesn't have a screen.  While we don't use it frequently, I worry that we will and Mateo will touch it.  A screen would help keep him safe.  <a href="http://www.target.com/p/threshold-fire-screen-black/-/A-14105058#prodSlot=medium_1_5&amp;term=fireplace+screen">This one from</a> Target looks decent and doesn't cost too much.</p>

<h2 id="babygates">Baby Gates</h2>

<p>Mateo is always getting into everywhere and everything he can.  Over Black Friday, we bought him a little corral to try to keep him in.  He will stay for a little while, but when he's not there (most all of the time), he's into everything.  It would be nice to have a baby gate for the bathroom (otherwise it's way to hot in their) and for the entry way area (extra wide).</p>

<h2 id="clothingtree">Clothing Tree</h2>

<p>I'd love to have something to hang up clothes without putting them away and especially not just throwing them on the floor.  Something <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/231108609223?lpid=82">like this</a> would be great in our bedroom.</p>

<p>As it's getting late and I need to be going to sleep.  The following is the rest of my list, unannotated.</p>

<ul>
<li>Good liquor (I want to try more scotches)</li>
<li>Chrome cup holders for my car.  The fake chrome stuff has been peeling and needs to be replaced.</li>
<li>New drill powertool</li>
<li>Chandelier for the entry way</li>
<li>For entryway bench (for taking off shoes, to sit and relax)</li>
<li>Speakers that play wirelessly (not bluetooth) to put in the bathroom / Mateo's room, den.</li>
<li>Cold stones for scotch (instead of ice, frozen rocks)</li>
<li>Hot cocoa to drink</li>
<li>Gloves and scarves</li>
<li>Books on tape</li>
<li>WiMo Outlets</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Greetings from Jacob, Minnie, and Mateo and best wishes for this holiday season.  The year before last was a difficult one, with Minnie’s mother dying, moving in Prosser, and Mateo getting ready to join our family, so we did not send out our annual Christmas letter.  This last year has been jam packed with changes for our family and we’ll at least share some of the highlights.</p>

<p>The biggest change happened just after Christmas last year.  On December 27th 2012, Minnie had gone in for her 36 week routine check-up and follow up as directed, (he was not due to arrive till much after the new year).  Her doctors office was concerned about Mateo’s heart beat and sent her to the hospital.  She called me and I left work right away.  About 30 minutes after I got there, Mateo Rodman Campbell V.S.P.  made his grand entrance into this world and was perfectly healthy.  He was the best after Christmas gift ever.</p>

<p>Having a baby changes everything.  Our lives have moved to be revolved around him.  The first few months of his life Minnie, Jacob, and Nana (grandma Judy) took time off work to stay home with Mateo until the summer time when Minnie was on summer vacation.</p>

<p>After Summer Break we moved from Prosser back to the Tri-Cities.  We bought a house in Pasco that was built in the mid  50's.  It has some very interesting architecture, additions that have been made, and a very mature yard.  It has been a lot of fun doing some projects around the home, and having a more stable place for Mateo to grow up.  Minnie changed jobs from the Sunnyside School District to being a para educator in a developmental preschool for the Pasco School District.  The kids in her  classroom are super busy and she is tired by the time she gets home, but she feels fulfilled by working there.</p>

<p>I am still working at Tri-Cities Community Health Behavioral Health Services as a case manager and therapist.  I stay busy doing that, trying to spend as much time as possible with the family, and still overcommitting myself to various community organizations.
We are both enjoying parenthood, although it has been hard a lot of times.  Mateo is growing up so fast.  He has been meeting all of his milestones. He is our little explorer.  He is constantly on the move and looking for new experiences.  He is almost walking and loves to babble, and says some words in English and Spanish.
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and God Bless from our family to yours. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This weekend we got the opportunity to go boating for the first time this year. While I've been able to BBQ a couple of times, it was the first thing that we've done all summer and spring that really felt like summer. It was really great, although I'm a lit more red for the ware (don't worry, my redness tends to turn into brown every year). You can even check out some photos from our boating extravaganza.</p><p> </p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

</div><p>The Tri-Cities has been experiencing extremely high temperatures, with it expected to be up to 106 on Wednesday. With all of my thoughts about summer, and how summers have changed since I was in college, I'm really excited to announce a pretty big change in my professional career.</p><iframe id="forecast_embed" type="text/html" frameborder="0" height="245" width="100%" src="http://forecast.io/embed/#lat=46.239752&lon=-119.105477&name=Pasco Washington"> </iframe>

<p>Starting in the middle of August, I've turned in my notice at Tri-Cities Community Health that I will be terminating my employment there. I've been working in their Behavioral Health Services department as a case management and therapist for the better part of three years, you can check out <a href="/resume">my resume</a> if your interested. It's been a really great experience. I have great co-workers, enjoy working with my patients, and have really learned a lot. That being said, working for a community mental health agency is difficult and fraught full of really high case loads and paperwork demands.</p>

<p>I've accepted a position with the <a href="http://www.psd1.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1">Pasco School District</a> as a mental health therapist. I'll be working at the elementary school and middle school levels leading groups, doing individual assessments, coordinating with outside agencies, and more. I'm very excited for this position, and have been ready for a change. Other than the fact that I'm sure I'm going to love the work, I'm really looking forward to having a school schedule and spending more time with my family and friends.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Are You Pondering What I'm Pondering Presentation</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/11/are-you-pondering-what-im-pondering-presentation</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently at work, I created a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for a training I did during one of our staff meetings. It is about affecting environmental change and empowerment theory. You can check out the tag Are You Pondering What I'm Pondering Presentation for all of the material that I uploaded regarding this presentation. It was really fun to put together, especially due to the fact that I used the theme of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_and_the_Brain">Pinky and the Brain</a>. During my presentation, I even featured the cartoon introduction copied off of YouTube. You can see it below and linked at <a href="http://youtu.be/iJPFSNu_QNs">Pinky and The Brain Intro</a> on YouTube. I created my own background title slide using some coloring page's I found online (I lost the links to them).</p>

I put together a video showing his growth over the last year in <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/iphoto/">iPhoto</a>.  I looked at a bunch of different ways of trying to put this video together.  I started in <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/imovie/">iMovie</a>, but it lacked control.  I looked at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html">Adobe Premier</a> but it is too complicated.  I even started to make a <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/">Keynote Presentation</a> with plans to make to export it as a movie. After starting, I decided that it would take way too long to individually animate each photo, and it would lack a consistent variance.  I decided finally to go with iPhoto and make a slide show.  It puts movies together quickly.  While it still lacks the control that I would like, I think that it turned out well.</p>

      <title>Tracking Trainings Using Dafts and Launch Center Pro</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/11/tracking-trainings-using-dafts-and-launch-center-pro</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="2048.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/5467078ce4b0621bf76f6a5c/1416038286101/image.jpg" alt=" Track Trainings for CEUs and Clock Hours using Drafts 4 &amp; Launch Center Pro "/>  Track Trainings for CEUs and Clock Hours using Drafts 4 &amp; Launch Center Pro [/caption] 
  

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I spent some times further diving into <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> and <a href="http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">Launch Center Pro</a>. Both are amazing applications for iOS, and have greatly improved my productivity and ability to get things done. I have been absolutely loving my <a href="/blog/2014/8/mileage-tracking-form-and-launch-center-pro">Milage Tracker</a> that I put together, and use it multiple times a day (and find that it makes it so I don't forget to track). As I have written before, I'm a big fan of using plain <a href="/blog/2014/3/review-of-david-sparkss-markdown-book-an-investigation-to-formatting-documents">text files and Markdown</a>.</p>

<p>Several years ago, when I started working at Tri-Cities Community Health Behavioral Health Services, and attending various trainings post MSW I started keeping a word document listing all of the various trainings that I attend. If you work in an industry that requires documentation regarding trainings received, hopefully you have started doing that too. I since have change my system around. I now have a plain text file that I keep on dropbox which has a listing of every training that I have received (whether that be in agency or for some sort of professional development certificate). As I have been looking towards applying for my <a href="http://www.doh.wa.gov/LicensesPermitsandCertificates/ProfessionsNewReneworUpdate/SocialWorker/LicenseRequirements/LicensedIndependentClinicalSocialWorker">LICSW</a> and having my <a href="https://www.k12.wa.us/certification/ESAMain.aspx">ESA</a> which requires so many clock hours, I decided that I wanted to also have an easy way to calculate how many CEU's or Clock Hours without combing through my long text file of all my trainings. I created two <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV files</a> which I could open in Excel or Numbers and have calculate the total number of hours easily. The problem is, I didn't want to have to write entries sometimes three times. I also wanted to be able to add these entries either from my phone or from my iPad easily when I get to the training. Never having to worry about it again.</p>

<p>With so many iOS automation tasks that I do, it starts in Launch Center Pro (LCP) for me. I have a main entry that collects data in several prompts (you <a href="https://launchcenterpro.com/t4zs0x">can install it</a>). The content is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>launch://x-callback-url/clipboard?text=[prompt:Review=[prompt:Date], [prompt:Training Title], [prompt-num:Number of CEUs or Clock Hours] [list:Type|Clock Hours=Clock Hours|CEUs=CEUs|Both=Clock Hours and CEUs], [list:Type of Units|Ethics= Professional Law and Ethics|Suicide=Suicide Assessment Treatment and Management|General=General Continuing Education Credits|None=|ESA Suicide=ESA Suicide Prevention Intervention Training]]
</code></pre>

<p>It creates a final review prompt that includes text regarding the training date, the title of the training, the number of hours, and the type of hours (i.e. Professional Law and Ethics or Suicide Assessment Treatment and Management). </p>

<p>I have this LCP action in my "base" actions folder along with a couple of different actions related to my trainings. All of them send the contents to Drafts for different actions. One action posts the clipboard to an action that appends it to my Clock Hour CSV, one to my CEU CSV, and one to my text file. I then have a main action that calls all of the other actions and let me select if I want to post it to one, two or all three of the actions.</p>

<p>The two actions that I have which append to my Clock Hour CSV and my CEU CSV files are very simple and just append to the files. There are two actions to append to my overall text file. One action takes the comma separated data and uses some JavaScript to split the text at each ", " and return the text with each section as a new line.  You can <a href="http://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com/a/1NF">install the drafts action</a> or see the JavaScript below:</p>

<pre><code>// Function to Parse Comma Separated Value Text
// Jacob Campbell -- http://jacobrcampbell.com/

function parseText(s){
    var temp = new Array();
    temp = s.split(', ');
      var result = "";
      var i;
    for(i=0; i&lt;temp.length; i++) {
        result += temp[i] + "\n";
    }
return result;
}

// Commit content to draft

var text = draft.content;
draft.content = parseText(text);
commit(draft);
</code></pre>

<p>The drafts action then passes that data to another action which takes those new lines and adds it to a template page that has the following information:</p>

<pre><code>## [[line|2]]
* __Date__: [[line|1]]  
* __Location__:   
* __Facilitator__:   
* __CEU / Clock Hours__: [[line|3]], [[line|4]]  
* __Duration__:   
* __Certificate of Completion__:   
</code></pre>

<p>Each of the the parts that say [[line|n]] takes that line from the draft and puts it there. I then add the last little bit of information (i.e. location, who facilitated it... etc) and I'm all done. </p>

<p>What is amazing, is I can write it once in LCP, have it post to both CSV files and then prepare it for posting it to my text file with only typing minimal text. I have taken it to another level, and have made some OmniFocus task templates that I can post and remember to follow up and see if I have received my confirmation form for my clock hours.</p>

<p>If you have the need to track your clock hours or CEU's its a pretty awesome system, and I'd highly encourage you steal what I have put together and change it for your own needs. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Weird Sleep Schedule</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/8/weird-sleep-schedule</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think all of these overnights that I'm working is catching up with me. A couple of nights ago, I worked an overnight and then had stuff I had to do all morning. I didn't fall asleep until like five or six pm. I think I was planning on just taking a nap, but slept until morning (like 12 hours). I just woke up from my most recent nap after working an overnight, going to sleep around one in the afternoon. Now it's nine pm. I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to do, because I work in the morning. Do I attempt to go to sleep again in a couple of hours... so I still get a decent amount of sleep because I just got like eight hours. Maybe I'm just trying to get ahead in my sleep so that I'm ready for Europe. Maybe I'm just crazy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Site Overhaul Complete</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/8/site-overhaul-complete</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since purchasing this domain name, and transferring all of it to here I have been going to though and giving the entire site a brief overhaul. I’ve had relatively limited experience with PHP. Since migrating my data, I have reduced it dramatically by utilizing the php language for includes for all the material that I add into each page. I have also added added and made a complete section for research and evidence based practice (link no longer valid). In completing this section I even utilized some JavaScript for the specific menu.</p>

<p>More than I have gotten done, I am still on the learning curve for some other projects on the site. For example I am attempting to be able to have an include file for my menu structure. The only problem is that I don’t want it to be static. I have struggled some with trying to implement cookies using the <code>setcookie()</code> and the <code>$_COOKIE</code> functions in php. I have had difficulty knowing how to debug it.</p>

<p>This would all change based on what specific page the viewer is on. I also loaded the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Maps API</a> and have attempted to build applications both with that and google earth.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I get off work in an hour and a half. In two hours I leave to take a 7.5 hour bus ride to Seattle. In one day I leave from Seattle and fly to Europe. The first leg of the journey is 9.5 hours, and lands in Copenhagen Denmark. From Copenhagen, it is a one hour flight to Berlin. Once in Europe I will be staying from August 18 till September 23 (five weeks). It's a pretty exciting trip… but I don't think it will really hit me until I'm actually there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Holiday's can always be remembered by what Charlie Brown Special was aired for them.  A Halloween favorite is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_the_Great_Pumpkin,_Charlie_Brown" title="Wikipedia Article:  The Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown">It's The Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown</a>.  If you are in a reminiscingessing mood, you can watch the entire episode below.</p>

<p>While it's not quite Halloween yet, fall is in full swing.  I have mixed emotions about fall.  I always say that I would prefer the heat to cold weather... I do really enjoy sweaters and the security they bring.  This halloween we do have another thing to look forward to, but I don't want to over sell it yet.  I'm pretty sure the costume idea we have for Mateo will be a giant hit. All I'm going to say for now is that "Adventure is out there!"</p>

<p>Another joy of the impending fall season is Harvest Events.  Earlier today Minnie, Mateo, and I all went to the <a href="http://www.countrymercantile.com/" title="Country Mercantile">Country Mercantile</a>.  Mateo was being a little bit grumpy.  Normally he is just a ham for the camera, but today we only got a few good smiles out of them.  The Country Mercantile is a generally cool store and always worth the drive to get some ice cream.  Especially if you have kids that are toddlers or older, the $6.50 entrance fee is well worth it.  There were a ton of great activities that Mateo is just not quite old enough to participate in.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fair style food booths</li>
<li>Amusement park rides</li>
<li>Petting zoo</li>
<li>Mountain of hay play area</li>
<li>Hay bale maze for toddlers</li>
<li>Corn maze</li>
<li>Hay bale ride</li>
<li>Enormous pumpkin patch</li>
</ul>

<p>When we went to the petting zoo (pretty small selection of animals, but cool non the less), they had a feisty cow.  We were trying to introduce Mateo to the cow, when he started introducing himself to Mateo.  With the cows Moo, Mateo started balling and completely freaked out.  I think he was overwhelmed by the smells and new sounds.</p>

<p>I'm really looking forward to when he is a bit older, and can run around some.  It seemed like it would be such a great place for him to run around and play.  This is particularly true for the little toddler maze and the giant hay bale pyramid.  Maybe next year, and hopefully it won't start to rain again.</p>

<p>Having my iPhone close, you know that I took a plethora of photos.  I am really enjoying the square aspect shots (like Instagram) and the photo filters that are built in for iOS 7.  I even got to play around with the panorama shot.  Anyways, I'll upload some of the pictures to the gallery below, but you can check out the rest of the photos on <a href="http://fb.com/jacobshouse">Facebook</a> in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.805817189176.1073741828.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=19d7058778">The Great Pumpkin Mateo Campbell</a>.</p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

<p>Today started our trip. After getting off work this morning, me and Trevor left to catch the bus. Neither of us really felt ready for the trip, and have stuff that we had to get done. I had hoped to have my house cleaned by when it was time to go. This obviously did not happen.We took the Greyhound from Spokane to Seattle... a stupid 7:30 minute ride. We didn’t know where we were going to stay, but found a pretty great hostel, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.greentortoise.net/">Green tortoise Hostel</a>. The room is clean, we have two other roommates (it’s dorm style). They had a great free dinner at which lots of the residents participated. I’ve met people already from Ireland, Australia, Japan, and Korea. They have some sort of activity everyday, today was a water balloon fight. The people seem pretty chill. Me and Trevor decided to wonder around Pike St. market and by the mall. We ended up at a pretty cool bar that had hundreds of taps posted on their walls. A pretty cool atmosphere.having not slept in about 48 hours, I think it is time to crash out and get ready to take off on our transcontinental flight in the morning.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We checked out of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.greentortoise.net/">Green Tortoise</a> at about 11:00 am yesterday and left in search of breakfast and coffee. It seems that street vendors often have good cheap food. After sitting in the coffee shop across the street and planning out the route for the rest of the day. We found a Barnes and Nobel and a radio shack and took the bus to the Airport. We arrived about 3 and a half hours before our flight was scheduled to leave. There was nobody at the check in counter. When we went up to the office, they told us that they had no more flights leaving today. The situation worked out, the worker was just incorrect. It was frightening moment.</p><p>The plane ride from Seattle to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>&nbsp;was long (about 9.5 hours). I didn’t have a window seat or one of the sought after emergency exit seats. I did have a pretty German girl to talk to, although we aren’t planning on going to where she is from.</p><p>Finally we arrived in Denmark. Lots of people spoke English, and it was easy to figure out the train system to get into town (the airport is about 15 minutes outside of town). Food, beer, and looking in all kinds of neat little shops. It’s a pretty good life. Coffee was expensive though (maybe we were getting ripped off for using USD thought. It cost $10 to get two cups of drip coffee.</p><p>Our flight finally got into <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin">Berlin</a>&nbsp;at around 8 pm local time. After not sleeping at all on the plan (meaning I hadn't slept for almost 48 hours), it was tiring to find a place to stay. The train, bus system seemed intimidating. Less people seem to speak English, it was dark, and our packs where heavy. The first Hostel we went to was booked, but luckily there was a nice one a couple blocks from there. So until tomorrow afternoon we will be staying at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meininger-hotels.com/en/hotel-hostel/hotelsearch/berlin/central-station/">Meininger Hostel</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The last two days seem to blur together some. I am coming to understand that my days here in Europe will be very full and have all sorts of different activities. The day before yesterday, we again stayed at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meininger-hotels.com/en/hotel-hostel/hotelsearch/berlin/central-station/">Meininger Hostel</a>, and hung out some with our dorm mate <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30718436&amp;l=8a276&amp;id=44504407">Carlos</a>. We spent a considerable amount of time walking all over <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin">Berlin</a>. I have since become fairly familiar and able to navigate my way around. This is especially true in regards to the subway / train system. It’s pretty easy to follow once you get the hang of it. We visited Märkisches Museum‎ (<a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode&amp;view=map&amp;q=M%C3%A4rkisches+Museum%E2%80%8E+Berlin+Germany&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=52.519668%2C13.413448&amp;spn=0.022875%2C0.064373&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=A">Märkisches Museum‎ Google Places Page</a>&nbsp;|| <a target="_blank" href="http://www.berlinstadtservice.de/xinh/Maerkische_Museum_Berlin.html">Märkisches Museum‎ Website</a>). They had wonderful exhibits depicting ancient history in Germany and Berlin. No photographs permitted though, or else I would prove that they used to have moose in Germany. They also had an exhibit showing the history of lights in Berlin.</p>

<p>After eating some dinner we started to make our way back to the Hostel. We decided to attempt to stop at all the various bars and restaurants for a drink till we made it back to the Hostel. One interesting bar / club that we stopped at was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitetrashfastfood.com/">White Trash Fast Food</a>. It was interesting seeing maybe some of what some people might think of America. The restaurant was full of cheap oriental decorations, red and white plaid table cloth, serving hamburgers and burritos, and playing 50’s to 80’s classic rock music. By the time we finally made it back to the hostel, not stumbling too hard we met our newest roommate. A older Messianic Jew from Israel. We then decided to head to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.matrix-berlin.de/">The Matrix Club - Berlin</a>. This place is huge, with four different dance floors playing various music. There were sections playing American rap and hip-hop, reggae, techno / house / whatever those styles are, and one playing rock music. It was jammed packed with people (at least a thousand young people), you can see <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30718435&amp;l=7db9a&amp;id=44504407">a picture of one of the dance floors</a>. Traveling by the S-Bahn, we were able to make it back to our hostel and to attempt to get some sleep at 5:45 am.</p><p>When you fall asleep at 5:45 am, and your alarm goes off at 9:30 after being out all night it is not a very happy sound. We check out of our over-heating room by 10, and were back on the road with our backpacks. Our bags each weigh 50-60 lbs, quite a load to carry all over the city. We debated finding a park and passing out for a couple of hours, but ended up eating ice cream, finding an internet cafe, and making our way to a new hostel. This last night we stayed at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Berolina-Backpacker/Berlin/5015">Barcelona Hostel</a>. The room was nice. I read, and explored while Trevor slept. Later that night we went to tour the Berlin Wall. There is an excellent exhibit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.berliner-mauer-gedenkstaette.de/en/">Gedenkstätte Berliner Mauer</a>. It was a very powerful portrayal of the history of the wall.</p><p>Today we are looking to go to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague">Prague</a> via bus. not exactly sure when we will leave Prague or how we are planning on getting back, but I’m sure it will work out. You can also see all the pictures that I uploaded to facebook from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509202492406.2026131.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=63c2a75df9">Copenhagen and Berlin</a>. Don’t forget to leave me comments about what you think below.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Bus trip and rainy searches for a hostel</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/8/bus-trip-and-rainy-searches-for-a-hostel</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As promised, we did go to <a href="http://g.co/maps/nj846" title="Link to Google maps">Prague</a> (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague" title="Wikipedia article on Prague">in Czech "Praha"</a>). It took 6 and a half hours to travel there by bus. We spent the morning wondering around the bus depot. Upon arriving in Prague, we figured out where we were fairly quickly. But we ended up wondering around in the rain until about 1:30 in the morning. We also talked to three different hostels. Our 16 person dorm room in the <a href="http://www.hostelmarabou.com/en/node/9" title="Hostel Marabou">Hostel Marabou</a> is pretty nice. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Prague, so many statues and beautiful streets</title>

<p>Our stay in Prague has been a blur of beautiful tours of the various sites, long walks back and forth to our hostel, late night to early morning going out, cathedrals and castles. All in all a great trip.</p><p>Our first day we went to the [<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nm.cz/index.php?xSET=lang&amp;xLANG=2">Národní Muzeum</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nm.cz/index.php?xSET=lang&amp;xLANG=2">National Museum</a>. We did not buy a camera pass so, there are no pictures from the inside. It was full of a zoological history of the world. So many ancient and modern species were represented. there was also history about the Czech Republic and their decent from communism and Russia. It was a very informative museum, although much of it was only in Czech. We spent much of the remainder of the day wondering around the winding streets of old Prague. I find the area to be very confusing. The buildings tower over the cobblestone streets. The old rock streets wind in and out of each other (changing names every few blocks) and never following a set grid. We found our way to [<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Astronomical_Clock">the Astronomical Clock</a>][10] in the town center. From the top you can see over the entire city (the top picture is taken from here, and shows the Prague Castle). After wondering around the town all day, we made it back to the Hostel about 20:00.</p>

<p>At the hostel there was a group of travelers getting ready to go out on a Pub Crawl. Neither me or Trevor had heard or been on a Pub Crawl before. The idea is that Travelers from all over (various hostels) all meet together at a specified location. Then they pay a local to get "free drinks" for the first hour and then to be taken to the cities best clubs. We found this to be a great way to meet people. About 10 people from our hostel went and we met up with about 50 other people. It was a pretty fun evening. Me and Marcelo (a guy from Brazil) didn’t get back until about 5:30 am.</p><p>After living up the night life in Prague, I woke up to go and see some more of the sites. Me and Trevor traveled to the other side of the river heading towards the Prague Castle. Along the way, there were a number of neat shops and amazing views. We crossed over <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge">Charles Bridge</a>&nbsp;which was jam packed full of people, street vendors, artists, and musicians. On the other side of the Charles Bridge we found the greatest statue that we found (and we saw a lot). I guess it might be a little mature, so don’t play it if you are easily offended;</p>

<p>We wondered up to the Prague Castle, which really was more of a old Cathedral. Positioned at the top of the hill just behind Prague, it gave a breath taking view of the old city. Standing in line wa go to hear some of the history of this building and about the Gargoyles that rest around the edge. After wondering around the Castle it was back to the Hostel to meet up with some people. We went out with some girls from Ireland… and had a pretty relaxed evening. The morning came too early and with that time to check out. Our bus leaves for Munich Germany at 23:55 and arrives at 05:30. hopefully we will be able to sleep on the bus. As for the rest of the day, I see us just spending time relaxing.</p><p>Facebook is currently not letting me upload the pictures… I will post links after it starts to work.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389504057119_22088">I am really glad to have been able to go to another German town other than Berlin. Berlin was a blast, a very young hip town. Munich (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich" data-cke-saved-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich" target="_blank">Münichen in German</a>), seems to be more conservative and upper class than Berlin. Although you won’t see throngs of people walking around the streets with their beer in hand, you will see some great beer halls and gardens. Munich is probably most famous for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest" data-cke-saved-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest" target="_blank">Octoberfest</a>, a holiday that I am sad we will be missing. We did go and see a number of sites around Munich that are notable. After arriving in Munich at about 05:30 am, we figured out their public transportation system and how to get to our next Hostel. We arrived very early in the morning to a place called <a href="http://www.the-tent.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.the-tent.com/" target="_blank">The Tent</a>. It is a very neat idea for a place to stay. Generally you can stay there for €10.50 or €5.50 if you want to utilize your own tent. They have these giant circus type tents, I think that two of them accommodate 150 people. A lot of the travelers tend to just hang out at the camp around the fire. We slept till later in the afternoon after checking in and decided to take the 15 minute tram ride to the center of town.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389504057119_22051">We wondered for a couple of hours around the center of town just taking in the sites. We saw a fairly neat church Saint Paul. We returned to the tent fairly early and just hung out with a everybody around the camp site.<br></p>

<p>The next morning, after sleeping in some and lounging around the campsite reading, we decided to really start our touring around Munich. The first stop was <a target="_blank" href="http://g.co/maps/w8azh">Englischer Garten Places Page</a> (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Englischer_Garten">Wikipedia article about Englischer Garten</a>)one of the worlds largest city parks... and much larger than New York’s Central Park. We found some locals who were heading to the park themselves and we made it there perfectly well from the subway system. Right at the entrance is a man made permanent wave, where people come and surf. It is a very neat site, fun to watch all of the surfer wipe out. Wondering down the path there are tons of people sitting out in the sun or the shade all over the park. It is also not uncommon for the locals to sunbathe nude in the park… it’s all just kind of mixed in. Although we didn’t lose our cloths around the park, we did loose some of our money at the parks great beer garden for lunch. There you can order an expensive L. of beer, some some traditional bavarian food (like a pork knuckle), and listen to the traditional music played by musicians in lederhosen. It is a fun experience. After wondering around the park for several hours (and still not seeing all of it), we decided that it was time to continue on. You can check out all of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509366897936.2026349.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=ad860a47b9">pictures from Englischer Garten and my trip to Munich on facebook</a>. We wondered around downtown for a while, finally deciding that we wanted to head to one of the most famous beer halls in Munich, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hofbraeuhaus.de/en/index_en.html">Hofbräuhaus</a>. I would have to say that it is a must see for anybody traveling in Munich.</p><p>After stopping at the grocery story, we headed back to the tent with a few surprises for our fellow guests. First we picked up some marshmallows (no chocolate and gram crackers… we’re having to live poor). Their marshmallows are smaller and don’t cook as well as ones in the USA, but everybody enjoyed them. The later it got, we started realizing how hungry we really where. We had bought some frozen chickens, and had started boiling them. They were taking a long time. Trevor was cooking, and when I went to go and check in on him I find him stabbing the chicken with some large pointed sticks. He hands the chicken to me and explains that I am supposed to go outside and cook it via the open fire. When this all starts, everybody body starts yelling and getting really excited. They even made a wave around the fire. We were the talk of the camp site. After about an a half hour of attempting to burn our chicken (maybe I should call it… cook it Cajun Style), we decided to take the blackened chicken back to the kitchen and cook it there. All in all it was a fun night</p><p>The following morning we checked out of the hostel and hung out till it was time for our bus to leave, heading to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna">Vienna Austria</a>. On the overnight bus, I had the opportunity to sit next to a German girl studying social work in Vienna. We ended up talking the whole night and was a really great connection. Too bad she had plans to be camping with her boyfriend over the weekend, so she wouldn’t be able to show us around. It was a really interesting connection though.</p><p>As promised, the photos from my facebook albums from Prague; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509282162746.2026235.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=d802fa994a">Prague 1 of 3</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509303534916.2026274.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=df69e44232">Prague 2 of 3</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509304702576.2026276.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=1bbad1c8fb">Prague 3 of 3</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389504057119_63383">In traveling, it seems that there are seasons of just going and doing. There are also some times that are refreshing like a cup of cool water. It has been a few days since I have written last (about four) and I’ve been in three different countries (Austria, Slovakia, and Spain). Within this whorl wind of visits, I have also found some amazing cups of cool water but I will have to get to those in a minute.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389504057119_61759">We arrived super early to Vienna Austria (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna" data-cke-saved-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna" target="_blank">Wien Österreich</a>), about 0500. We planned to stay at <a href="http://www.wombats-hostels.com/vienna/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.wombats-hostels.com/vienna/" target="_blank">the Wombats Youth Hostel</a>, a place in our travels that has come highly recommended. They let us reserve some beds in their dorm, but we were not allowed to actually check in until 1400. Tired, we took showers in their guest showers and ventured into the early morning streets of Vienna. After stopping for breakfast (if you can call a few slices of cheese, meat, garnish, and coffee that) we were both exhausted. We walked about a couple of parks hoping for a bench or nice slab of grass to pass out in. We made our way back to the hostel… but it was still way too early to check in. We both ended up passing out on the sidewalk in the front of the building. After checking in, we took a short nap. I wondered around the city for while and hung out and meet some travelers in the hostel bar. When Trevor finally woke up me, him, Lisa and Chris (a couple from Australia) decided to sneak into the other Wombat bar. It just sounded like fun. We shared Jägerbombs with a couple from Belgem and talked with some film makers from Texas.</p>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389504057119_61496">As always, the next morning came too early and it was time to check into a new hostel (Wombats was full the next night). We found a room at <a href="http://www.hostelruthensteiner.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.hostelruthensteiner.com/" target="_blank">Hostel Ruthensteiner</a>, really a close walk. We again wondered around Vienna. We walked along a main shopping district and watched all of the various street performers. After walking in circles for a bit trying to find our way, we found the Naschmarkt. This seems to be a mixture of open air stores and a flea market. Following all of the winding trails under umbrellas and throngs of people, only to find some very interesting pictures. You can find all of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509459622116.2026486.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=486744b8a9" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509459622116.2026486.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=486744b8a9" target="_blank">the photos from Vienna on facebook</a>.<br></p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389504057119_62910">Riding the underground to the <a href="http://www.schoenbrunn.at/en/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.schoenbrunn.at/en/" target="_blank">Schönbrunn Palace</a>&nbsp;it was breath taking to see. The garden behind had millions of little areas to go and explore. That night we went out for a couple of hours. The next morning we were on our way to Slovakia. You’ll have to hear about the cool water experiences a bit later. It's almost 2130 and I’m supposed to meet up with Trevor in a couple of minutes. Currently I’m in Barcelona… so I’ve got quite a bit to catch you up on.</p>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389509286529_13054">You can see pictures of Bratislava and Castle Devin on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509536742566.2026594.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=8ebf4963ce" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509536742566.2026594.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=8ebf4963ce" target="_blank">Facebook album <em>Ahoj, Bratislava here we come</em></a>. We have taken a couple of flights though a cheap airlines in Europe, Ryan Air. They never fly to the major city that you are trying to get to. For example they advertise flying to Vienna but they really fly out of Slovakia (about a 50 minute train ride). I’m really glad to have gotten to go though. It can be very worth it if you can find flights for like 10-30 Euro’s, just watch out for all of the added fees… and luggage restrictions.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389509286529_13057">We got into Bratislava and were both ready for a relaxation day. We wondered around town for a little bit, found our way to a grocery store. We bought some random meat and cheese that we weren’t exactly sure what it was. I bought some fish kabobs and some potatoes. We returned to <a href="http://www.patiohostel.com/index2.php?lang=eng&amp;action=home" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.patiohostel.com/index2.php?lang=eng&amp;action=home" target="_blank">Patio Hostel</a>&nbsp;where we would be staying the night. Trevor cooked what he called a travelers meal. We chilled out and watched a movie and just relaxed for the night.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389509286529_13060">While doing some laundry in the middle of the night (that’s when everybody does laundry, right?) I had my first cup of cool water experience. It has been a little while since I spent some time worshiping, and it seems as if we have had many Sunday’s as our travel days. Sitting in the laundry room I got to spend like an hour just worshiping, reading my bible and praying. I was very dry and thirsty for some of God’s Presence.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389509286529_13063">The next morning we made a trip to Castle Devin. It was a spectacular castle, and the first very old one that we have gone and toured. It was first started to be built a bit before 900 A.D.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389509286529_13066">Over looking the river the view was spectacular. I was hoping to find a dungeon, but everything below the castle was locked up.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389509286529_13069">After wondering around ancient castle it was time to catch a bus and then an over priced taxi to the airport. It was then that I found my second cup of cool water. We met a fellow traveler Jaume. He was in Bratislava and traveling back home to Barcelona. We shared some coffee and some conversation. It was not until we later that we would recognize him as one of the coolest and most hospitable travelers we had met so far</p><h2 id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389509286529_13072">Barcelona, Beaches, The City By Night, Missed Connections, and Prostitutes</h2>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="2500.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/52d23e0ee4b02079e16118eb/1432258930598/photo-barcelona-beach.jpg" alt=" Beach at Barcelona "/>  Beach at Barcelona [/caption] 
  

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389509286529_21256">Jaume offered to drive us to the city. We stopped and had a sandwich on the way for some dinner. He called our hostel for us and made sure that they had rooms, giving us our first reservations on the trip. After taking us to the door and making sure everything was alright at the hostel for us he went home to get only a few hours of sleep He also offered to meet us the next night and show us around Barcelona.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389509286529_21259">The next morning we headed out to the beach. You can see all of my pictures from Barcelona on Facebook Album <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509536937176.2026595.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=f73146678f" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.509536937176.2026595.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=f73146678f" target="_blank"><em>Barcelona, burning at the beach</em></a>. It felt so amazing to just be able to lay on a beach and go and jump in at will. I must say that my shorts collection has thinned out considerably due to RyanAir. They only allow 15 kilos (about 33 lbs) on any of their flights, so my first flight I let go of a lot of different items. One of these items was my swimsuit I packed. My cargo shorts worked just fine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;After a day wondering around the beautiful beaches, we found our way back to La Ramblas a very touristy area. We just relaxed for a while until it was time to be picked up by Jaume. He came and took us to some places that it would have been impossible to find ourselves. First we went some streets and showed us some of the Gaudi architecture, which is very impressive. The next stop was at Basilica of Santa Maria del Mar. A very impressive work in progress. It is being built completely from public donations. A very amazing feat, not to mention the math that was required to be done when it was designed. He then took us up to the top of a two mountains and showed us city by night. It was phenomenal. We then went to get some drinks and Jaume left us on our own. We found our way to the beach and took a midnight swim with some travelers from France, Australia, and the UK. Coming back at 3 am we ran into some of Barcelona’s prostitutes. They whistle and kiss at you. Then they grab your arm and don’t want to let go. It was quite disconcerting.</p><p>After waking up in the morning at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hfernando.com/">Hostel Fernando</a> and going to check email we realized that we had a problem. We were supposed to fly out that morning. the whole time we thought we had three days, not two nights. It can be so confusing traveling. Anyways, my paid time for the internet is coming up and I will tell you about Rome later.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Suck, Suck, Major Suck</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/9/suck-suck-major-suck</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you can expect to not have me uploading more pictures for a while. Currently my computer is broken. I don’t know if it is from stuffing my computer bag into my backpacking bag (which I have done the entire trip) or from keeping it in the hostel safe in Riga. I tried to expect something to happen to my computer during my trip, but it still sucks when it does. Some how the computer screen got cracked and now I can’t see out of it (using one of the hostels computers). I think that it might be that back in the states I am way too attached to my computer, but whatever, it will work out. Anyways, to everybody out there who has had their computers broken or to people who got expensive things stolen from them (i.e. Nadja).</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>From Hot to Cold</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/9/from-hot-to-cold</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="allroadsleadtorome">All Roads Lead to Rome</h2>

<p>I guess it’s time to play a little catch up for everybody. It’s been a while since I’ve posted and since I’ve lost my computer I’ve been very much more at the whim of public computers with weird keyboards, high costs (not too bad... but not as cheap as free), and slow old hardware.</p>

<p>Trevor and I spent four nights in Rome. We arrived into Rome city center fairly late (maybe 2300 hours). We had a couple of ideas of hostels, but they all seemed to be booked. We ran around the city center for about 2 hours with our packs but were unsuccessful in finding a cheap hostel. We finally settled to stay at this over priced place (about 30 Euros a night) for the first night. The next morning we made our way to Camping Plus about 50 km outside of town. It was pretty perfect, and probably had the best showers that we’ve had the entire trip. I made my way back into town and wondered around the Vatican. I spent most of my time in a the St. Pietro. It was an amazing church. You can see about half of my photos from Rome and the Vatican, but the rest will have to wait till I get back to the states and figure out what to do with my computer. I also found my way to the Pantheon, an amazing building. I came back before it got to late and hung out with some travelers from the UK in the bar at the campsite.</p>

<p>Trevor and I ended up not seeing the sites together in Rome. Maybe it was time to have a break from hanging out 24 7. The next morning, sleeping in was a glorious experience. I made my way to the Colosseum. It is truly a massive building. Laying out in the grass in front I got to hear a part of a English speaking tour for free. In front of the Colosseum, there were all of these guy’s dressed like Romans for you to take your picture with. I should have expected that they were going to try to rip me off, when he asks if my watch was a rollex (I spent 10 Euro’s to buy a watch because I was so tired of never having a clue what time it was). I asked him how much to take a picture, and he said a tip. Got a couple of amazing pictures. Then he held onto my camera and said that it was going to be 10 Euros (about 16 USD). I told him to just delete the pictures.</p>

<p>I made my way back to the campsite to go swimming for a bit. Then I met up with some travelers that I had met the night before. A girl from Sweden and one from Ukraine. We had planned to go out into Rome that evening. After getting some food and making a quick stop back at their tent before taking off, they found out that somebody had stolen a bunch of their stuff. Some of it was very expensive too. We spent much of the evening trying to talk to the police (so they could get money back from their insurance). Then we played Mao until early in the morning. Good times. Me and Trevor met up with them again and wondered around the city later the next day. Our plane left the next morning at like 5am... stupid early. We decided not to sleep and just go to the airport with our bags. We ended up not figuring out how to get to the train stop that we were attempting to, but found a group of Italian youth who were actually heading to the same airport.</p>

<p>You must really attempt to imagine this. We are o a bus, and realize that we just missed our stop. I hear some people talking to the bus driver about the Camino airport (another Ryan Air stop). We are trying to communicate with them, although they don’t speak English. After following them, we find out that they are planning to walk to the airport. We see them stop and ask for directions several times and go the wrong direction at least once. The entire trek took about an hour and a half, while carrying our bags. By the end we were drenched in sweat, but proud of ourselves.</p>

<h2 id="citiesinsteadofcapitalsthetownofbergemo">Cities Instead of Capitals, the Town of Bergemo</h2>

<p>Much of our trip so far, we have only really hit up capitals and major cities within a country. Bergemo was a nice break from that. Although less people spoke English, people were more willing to help. We met a waiter who was very excited to meet us when he heard us speak English. As soon as he heard we were from the USA, he asked Obama or McCain. We spent two nights at <a href="http://www.ostellodibergamo.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=215&amp;lang=en" title="Bergamo Youth Hostel">Bergamo Youth Hostel</a>. It was pretty fantastic, except that it cost 8 Euros to do laundry.</p>

<h2 id="doyoureallyhavetoknowwheresomethingistoflythereriga">Do You Really Have to Know Where Something is to Fly There, Riga</h2>

<p>We weren’t sure were we were going next so we decided to see where was fairly cheap to fly to, and stay (i.e. Eastern Europe). We found a city, Riga in Latvia. Neither of us had ever heard of Latvia or Riga, but it sounded like a great plan. We just went, not knowing anything and it was a great city. We stayed at <a href="http://www.franksbackpackers.hostel.com/" title="Friendly Fun Franks Hostel">Friendly Fun Franks Hostel</a>. What a name hu? It was a really great place, although a bit rowdy. Any place that you walk in the door and they tell you take your backpack off and ask you if you want a free beer before even checking you in is pretty amazing. We wondered around Riga for two days. We got to see the view from the tallest church that overlooks the city and the river. We met some pretty cool Irish travelers. We explored a lot of the old USSR buildings. It was a great time.</p>

<h2 id="itgetscolderpoland">It gets colder, Poland</h2>

<p>Currently I’m in Poland. Krakow to be precise. We took a 12 hour overnight bus from Riga to Warsaw, and spent the night before last in Warsaw. Then Yesterday we came to Krakow. Krakow is a pretty cool old town. Much of it dates back to the 13th Century and it was left un-touched during the War. More to come soon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Even While Traveling, Still a Nerd</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/9/even-while-traveling-still-a-nerd</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I sat around the hostel most of the night. I think I’m coming down with a cold, which is a stupid thing to have happen when your traveling. After eating a Kabob (the most excellent type of vendor food out there), a couple of us sat down a watched a movie. I’ve been dowsing myself with green tea, hoping to fend off this cold quickly. While checking stuff online, I stumbled across <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en-US/more/index.html" title="Google’s new Google Chrome Browser">Google’s new Google Chrome Browser</a>. I have been a strong supporter of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" title="FireFox">FireFox</a> as a default browser. But a new browser coming from Google might change my stance. I spent the last 15 or 20 minutes reading the <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/small_00.html" title="Comic Book description of the browser">Comic Book description of the browser</a>. It was very interesting and something I’d recommend to anybody that has a bit of a techno-geek inside of them. I was fairly convinced about the new browser. It will be a while for me to test it out and see what I really think once I get home, but I might have to change.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Still a bit sick, but I slept in very late and probably wondering around in on a cold rainy day isn’t the best idea. I really didn’t want to stay sick all day, so I figured I would just tough though it. After sleeping in late, I made my way to Wawel Castle and the Cathedral that is their. It is very beautiful, and houses the kripts for many influencial people from Poland. Listening to my audio guide I was struck by how many of them had so many scenes depicting their lives. On their caskets, it showed the major events that transpired in their lives. It got me to thinking about what at the end of my life might go on my casket or what I would want to be remembered by. Above is a song by Tupac, “How long will they mourn me.” It also made me think about this. Anyways, just a thought. Also, be advised that the song has a lot of explicit lyrics.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Way Home</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/9/the-way-home</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Currently I am sitting in the Airport at Heathrow in London… and absolutely huge airport. But to catch you up on events, I have about 18 minutes until it’s time to go and catch a plane home. So this post might be trying to fit a lot in, with a very short time.</p>

<h2 id="krakowauschwitzandmorerain">Krakow, Auschwitz, and More Rain</h2>

<p>I loved Krakow, except for all of the rain. All of my clothes where dirty (also, sorry about any spelling mistakes in this post… the computer I’m using has some stupid browser, so I can’t do much) so I wondered around in shorts and flip flops in the cold rainy days in Poland. I finally broke down and bought a new pair of pants too from the local mall. The last day that we were in Krakow we made a expedition to Auschwitz.</p>

<p>I went to the Holocost Museum in Washington D.C. years ago with the Master’s Commission. It was probably one of the most impactful places that I’ve ever been. It was really quite a different experiance to actually walk on the ground where so many people were murdered. We also went to Birkkenau, where all of teh crematoriums were. The whole place just had an eiry sad feeling to it.</p>

<h2 id="budepestandspasat2am">Budepest and Spa’s at 2am</h2>

<p>Budepest is one of the few cities that I’ve been to that I really could see myself living in. I would highly reccomend if you are making a Europe trip to go to Budepest (and lots of Eastern Europe). There are lots of great sites to go and see. We saw a church built into a rock cave (cave church), climed a hill with a spectacular view of the city and cool little shops. There are many different Thermal springs in Budepest, and we went to one and stayed there late into the night. Really it was such a great place, that we ended up staying longer than we planned and buying a second plane ticket.</p>

<p>When traveling it is a great idea to be very thurough when making travel arrangements. For example if you buy a ticket going to the airport, you should know if it is the only stop or not. We ended up going to a town in the country of Hungery instead of the airport. We met the nicest young couple home for the weekend from University. They took us to their parents house, made food for us, drove us to the train station and even waited for the train to leave us. They were an amazingly hospitable family and was a great experiance.</p>

<h2 id="londononlyforthreedays">London only for Three Days</h2>

<p>London is a huge, world class city. It took almost 2 hours to get from one side to the other throught the underground. The sites were beautiful. I will upload pictures when I get home. We took a free walking tour which was interesting and the Austrialian leading it was hillariaous. It was a great stay, but way to short. London really needs at least a week to do it any justice, but I was glad for the three nights.</p>

<p>I stand here now, needing to leave for my plane (I don’t want to miss this one, it wouldn’t be a good idea). I am sad to know that I’m going to be stopping traveling, but happy to come home and see friends and family. I hope to see all of you soon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During my trip I lost, broke, or other crazy events happened. The following is a list of all the things big and small.</p>

<ul>
<li>I didn’t get stickers for my water bottle (the one souvenir that i got from every where I went) in <a href="/blog?tag=Copenhagen%20Denmark">Denmark</a> and the <a href="/blog?tag=Prague%20Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>.</li>
<li>In <a href="/blog">Berlin</a>, before we even left for our second city... I forgot my favorite hoodie at the bus station. I must say that while in the US I’ve had people offer to buy this hoodie off of me while at coffee shops... maybe I should have taken them up on the offer.</li>
<li>I lost my time. I bought post cards to sent to friends and family in <a href="/blog?tag=Prague%20Czech%20Republic">Prague</a>... but never sent them off. I actually thew them away when I got to the US, even though I filled them out.</li>
<li>In preparation of flying, I sold my tent for €10.00 (about $13.48800)... probably worth at least $100.</li>
<li><a href="/blog?tag=Vienna%20Austria">Vienna</a> was the first country that we decided to fly from... well actually <a href="/blog?tag=Bratislava%20Slovakia">Bratislava</a>. I threw away a number of other camping gear, rain gear, and several sets of cloths (leaving me with 2 shorts, 1 pants and a bunch of shirts and other stuff) at the airport.</li>
<li>In <a href="/blog?tag=Barcelona%20Spain">Barcelona</a>, we lost an airplane ticket... we though we were staying an extra day.</li>
<li>I also tore one of my shorts, leaving me with 1 pair of shorts and 1 pair of pants.</li>
<li>Due to my computer breaking (see later item in list) I lost many of my pictures of <a href="/blog?tag=Rome%20Italy">Rome</a> and <a href="/blog?tag=Bergemo%20Italy">Bergemo</a>.</li>
<li>In <a href="/blog?tag=Riga%20Latvia">Lativa</a>, I broke my computer (or maybe the hostel I was staying at... not exactly sure). Luckily I was able to purchase an accidental protection plan when I got home. This still cost me close to $400, and made be very broke!</li>
<li>In <a href="/blog?tag=Riga%20Latvia">Riga</a>, I told a friend that I would get him a souvenir. The shops closed before I made it there, and I didn’t get him the one I wanted to (cool leather covered liquor bottle).</li>
<li><p>Somebody stole my €10.00 plastic watch that I bought because I was tired of never knowing what time it was and being late for check out time.</p></li>
<li><p>In <a href="/blog?tag=Krakow%20Poland">Krakow</a> I tore my only pair of pants beyond repair... leaving me with one pair of pants. Also, my flip flops broke forcing me to walk in the rain with my right foot continually falling out of the thong.</p></li>
<li>I also did cosmetic damage to the second watch that I purchased in <a href="/blog?tag=Warsaw%20Poland">Warsaw</a>... due to losing the first one.</li>
<li>In <a href="/blog?tag=Budapest%20Hungary">Budapest</a>, we missed another plane, and I think I got bit by bed bugs.</li>
<li>In <a href="/blog?tag=London%20United%20Kingdom">London</a>, I lost a cool zippo lighter that I bought in the <a href="/blog?tag=Prague%20Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>.</li>
<li>I bought a map that my "Lets Go Western Europe" suggested and realized it was worthless, so I traded it for a much cheaper better one.</li>
<li>The button on my last pair of shorts broke, almost leaving me pants less while going though airport security.</li>
<li>I lost Trevor in Europe, he decided not to come back with me and is currently in Spain.</li>
<li>After getting home to <a href="/blog?tag=Seattle%20Washington">Seattle</a>, I lost my cell phone in a taxi.</li>
<li>I got home, and my computer was broken, I lost my cell phone so I felt very disconnected from life… and realized that somebody stole my bike.</li>
<li>Finally I lost my financial security. I’ve gone back to donating plasma (first time today in a long time), haven’t bought groceries and am hoping to get paid before my rent is due... other wise I’ll have to figure out something quick</li>
</ul>

<p>Although that is quite a list of lost items, I wouldn’t trade my trip experience for any of it or all of it. It was a truly amazing trip. I really could have made a longer list of all the things I got from the trip, but thought that this was a bit funnier. When / if you have traveled, have you lost, broke or done something else to your stuff.</p>

      <title>Google Elections</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/10/google-elections</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I must say that I am slightly biased as to which online products I like for various activities. I recently came across <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/2008election/">Google 2008 U.S. Elections</a>. This has many different Google products that bring up various election features. One of these that I think is very cool is the Google Maps Elections ‘08 Map Gallery. One example of the maps that are available is Candidate Queries Map from Google, but their is a host of other ones listed in the gallery.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Now you can read what I'm reading</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/10/now-you-can-read-what-im-reading</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the benefits of working in the afternoon is that I have time to take my mornings slowly. I tend to sit outside and and drink a cup of coffee and read the news most mornings now. I read my news from <a href="http://news.google.com/" title="Google News">Google News</a>. I have made <a href="http://news.google.com/news?ned=%3AePkh8BM9E2IRYipIFZLnEgguyM9OzEvVUQh31FEIDXY0YHFitbQ0MjD12DxXQ4gV6BQDFpDq1By4a1JBwiVAYZhTioWOMXJxB-cnZybmKITnF2VrbWFUQuYqKfgHKSh5lOYm5ikEpxaVZSanQsX8HIPDoazEksz8PKAOx-JikFYQTyE_TQHTnODkjPz8HCQ5qLgn3CznxOJUZB1gvm9iXmI6zF6YToWg1OLUxKLkDC2gKQZsQvJassWZJalW5eXleqmJxSWpRXmpRfl5OZl5qXrJ-bn6QmpaKmAFGSUlBVb6-iB1xcAgTC0G-q0otSwztRysDhY5RgIhcvcuxnCIlhxMeM9Qt_Oe8y82YFj-YmPNyU9OBNLMRanJAI5jdf4" title="Personalized Google News">several personalization</a> to the news that I read, and thought you might be interested in checking them out. You’ll see that in the recommended for me section there is a lot of information regarding technology and the election. I tend to read these a lot. I also have a section that searches the news for all the stories that are connected to social work and related material. I also have Googles local news for my area code and an addition of local news that isn’t included in their searching (the Spokesman Review, and the Easterner my schools newspaper). I hope this is interesting for you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Who Knew Ordering Pizza Could be Cool</title>

<p>I got off work tonight, and was hungry. I don’t have any food in my house, and am in desperate need of going grocery shopping. For some reason, this didn’t sound like a good idea at almost midnight when I got home. I decided to order pizza. Looking up <a href="http://www.dominos.com/" title="Domino's">dominoes</a> online, I found their order process super easy and kind of cool. I just had to enter information, and it placed my order. The confirmation page (see below) told me who began baking my pizza and when, and the same for putting it in the oven, boxing it up, and leaving for delivery. That’s pretty sweet. Probably more information than I need to know, but still very cool to know.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This weekend was the Fervent <a target="_blank" href="http://www.victoryfaith.org/">Victory Faith</a>'s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.victoryfaith.org/fervent/">college age group called Fervent</a>&nbsp;retreat. It was awesome. Unfortunately I did not get to go up for the entire event. I worked on Friday until about 1am. I got up there Saturday and it was pretty awesome. As Joe would say "I got saved."</p><p>It has been a long time since I've really felt connected with church or even some sort of community. The last couple of years, I've had a number of groups that I got to build relationship with, but this year it's been pretty dry. I have some friends that I hang out with at Eastern, but not nearly as much as when I lived on campus, or even last year when I hung out in Cheney quite a bit. I also haven't really been to the Spokane Dance Company since I stopped doing the instructor training program. I just really haven't hung out with people all that much the last couple of months. When I was in Europe, I met tons of people… but friends you make while traveling are way different then people you know more in-depth.</p><p>Needless to say, getting to hang out with a bunch of people at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tcreek.org/">Camp Tshimakain</a>&nbsp;was a very good thing. Joe's word regarding community (and building relationship last Fervent meeting for that matter) was powerful to me and what I needed to hear. God is so good that way, he always meets us right where we are.</p><p>Thank you for everybody I got to hang out with at the retreat, it was the first time I've really felt connected in quite a while. It's been really dry and you are all an encouragement to me. I appreciate all of you so much.</p><p>You can check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.510782121816.2028508.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=b998a2f5c8">Fervent Retreat Album</a>&nbsp;from the retreat.

      <title>My Website has Been in Every State, Plus Two</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/52d30817e4b08765f4545157/1389561880515/image-google-map-anaylitics-website.png" alt=""/>
  

<p>Checking out my Google Analytics this morning, I realized that my website has been visited by people in every state this previous month. It's like I can travel around the country (really the world for that matter) every month. <a href="/s/google-analytics_report-map.pdf">My Analytics US Map Overlay</a> tells me that I've had visitors from 52 states. One of the extra is unspecified and the other is Washington DC. I thought thought that it was a pretty cool thought. Also, it's pretty cool that I got 1,412 visits this month. That number is pretty constant too. Someday I will probably upload monthly reports so other people can follow my traffic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>My church, <a href="http://www.victoryfaith.org/" title="Victory Faith Fellowship">Victory Faith Fellowship</a>, has been undergoing a lot of changes lately.</p>

<p>One huge leap of faith that we have made is in purchasing a new building. It has really been an amazing story of our church following after Gods dreams, which are bigger than anything that we could do ourself. It has really been a great ride so far. This Sunday, we will have our first meeting at <a href="http://g.co/maps/e85h2" title="Google Maps of 2024 N Argonne Rd">2024 N Argonne Rd</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Stupid Flash Debugging</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/11/stupid-flash-debugging</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I taught myself xHTML, CSS several years ago. Since then I have learned some PHP and JavaScript, VisualBasic, and C++. The newest thing that I have been working on is Fash. It's been really interesting, but I don't think I have a great grasp on action script and I can even fail at following a <a href="http://www.flash-game-design.com/flash-tutorials/gallery-flash-tutorial.html">Tutorial</a> on creating a gallery. I like to work though some things like this to take breaks from studying and other projects that I am working on. The final product was supposed to look like this <a href="/s/flash-gallery-tutorial-example.swf">tutorial gallery</a>:</p>
 
   <iframe src="https://jacob-campbell.squarespace.com/s/flash-gallery-tutorial-example.swf"></iframe>
 
<p>But mine (remember that some of it was quickly done... so isn't as pretty) <a href="/s/flash-gallery-tutorial-try.swf">Flash Gallery Tutorial</a> did not work:</p>
 
   <iframe src="https://jacob-campbell.squarespace.com/s/flash-gallery-tutorial-try.swf"></iframe>
 
<p>Anyways, I guess enough playing around with it today. I'll have to go back though and see where I messed up later, I need to work on my literature review for my research project.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>So... It Starts Again</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/1/lajrg9u0w5qpgwyp820vdmfk2s043o</link>

"/>  My yard in Spokane all snowy. [/caption] 
  

<p>I guess I can say that it officially starts again. Winter is upon us. First I must say that I have been thankful for a lot of things this year. Two things I was especially thankful was that I could go to see my family in Tacoma over Thanksgiving (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.511383087476.2029437.44504407&amp;l=d4b01" title="Family Thanksgiving 2008">Pictures on Facebook</a>). Seeing as how I only had a couple of days off for Thanksgiving and will not have Christmas Eve, Christmas, or New Years Eve off this year… I was very happy to be able to see my family.</p>

<p>Me and my mom drove back to Tri-Cities, I helped her move a table and hung out with an old friend for a while. But as I got back to Spokane, I started seeing a bunch of fog... and then some white stuff on the ground. I guess I kind of expected to come back and see snow on the ground, but was not excited. Maybe I can go sledding soon, but as for driving around I'm not excited.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>My mom keeps telling me that I will need to change my sleeping schedule to more regular hours as I enter into more professional arenas. Waking up at 6:30 am this morning I decided that this is probably true. I got up before there was light this morning so that I could attend <a target="_blank" href="http://www.childrensalliance.org/">Children's Alliance</a>s' legislative breakfast in Spokane. This event both provoked me to better service and gave me a better perspective on on the shape of Washington's economy.</p><p>The event took place at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nativeproject.org/">Native Project's</a>&nbsp;wonderful facilitates. I got the opportunity to see many people who I have worked with from the School of Social Work at Eastern, Juvenile Court, and YFA Connections. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/senate/senators/Pages/brown.aspx">Senator Lisa Brown</a>&nbsp;also came and spoke.</p><p>We spent time looking at what Principles are needed for budget decisions in tough times. I found it particularly powerful to hear <a target="_blank" href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/house/representatives/Pages/ormsby.aspx">Representative Timm Ormsby</a>&nbsp;described one of his views on budgets. He said that the things that we choose to fund in our budgets really show our values. The lobbyist for Children's Alliance, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/teresa-mosqueda/6/21/b98">Teresa Mosqueda</a>&nbsp;explained their five legislative focuses for the 2009 legislature. Lisa Brown talked about the six billion budget shortfall that Washington State is looking at and some of what that might mean for social service organizations.</p>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1389563652656_45978">One thing that I did not hear talked about was adolescents. There was a lot of focus regarding young children and there needs, but seemed to be lacking care for teenagers. The only lobby focus that Children's Alliance is having regarding teenagers would be health care coverage for every child by 2010 and foster care reform. Neither of these are focused on adolescents, they would just be helped as a type of by product. I firmly believe in programs focused on young children. This will elevate the need for some services when they become adolescents. This is a sort of macro focus for working with adolescents. We need to solve some of the issues that cause them to need services later in life. This is vital, but just as vital is to help those at risk youth now (a kind of micro and mezzo focus). We have a responsibility to continue to provide services to those who are right in front of us.<br></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Information Overload</title>
      <link>/blog/2008/12/information-overload</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm not exactly sure if it's information overload, but getting off work tonight I felt like my brain was going to explode. I woke up this morning to go to a meeting with my research group mates. We needed to prepare for our Institutional Board Review meeting regarding our research project. We are looking into the effectiveness of one of the programs where I work. It should be really interesting when everything is all said and done.</p>

<p>The Institutional Review Board meeting was really interesting and got into a lot of really great information. We have a number of edits to make, but all of them are fairly minor. I really believe that the many hours me and my group have put into our project were well spent in creating a great product. After deciding to get together first thing tomorrow to make a majority of the edits, I was off to home to send a flury of emails and then to work.</p>

<p>I got to work over a half hour early, but I guess that I should have gotten there much earlier. I've been working in some off time on creating a database in MS Access to store information on various grants. It's been kind of cool to spend time working with databases, because it's not an area I have a lot of experience in yet. Anyways, as soon as I came in, I was demonstrating and talking about the database. As my shift started, I took a minute to prepare for my family session that I would be facilitating. This family is the first that I will be working with all the way through. It went well, but the rest of the day seemed non stop. Leading group felt like a failure… but I guess that happens sometimes and it is really difficult to try to teach a group of teenagers about taking responsibility for themselves.</p>

<p>All in all, I guess I'm just a bit tired and ready for to actually seem like winter break. Maybe next week, but I wouldn't be too sure about that. I also heard an interesting story on NPR (well, actually I think it was Austrialias public radio) about a website that Austrialia just started. It's called <a href="http://www.talkingworks.com.au/" title="Talking Works">Talking Works</a>. It's a pretty interesting idea. The website is basically to reach out to youth in Australia who are "missing," i.e. ran away from home or something like that. I don't think that we have anything as youth focused here in the states, and I liked the format of the site. I wonder if it would besomething that might be productive to have here in the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Soldiering for Social Work</title>

<p>Since the <a target="_blank" href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008536133_apwawinterweatherspokane4thldwritethru.html">massive snow storm</a> in Spokane, I have felt a little bit like a soldier going to work. I have also seen some things take place that I do not think where right. On Wednesday, 12/17/08, the snow started coming in heavy. I found myself staying much later at work, something I have found myself doing a lot lately, because of an open house at the <a target="_blank" href="http://yfaconnections.org">Crisis Residential Center</a> (CRC). Even with all of the snow, we still had a couple of people show up. When I was finally ready to leave there my car was completely covered, just like the roads all over Spokane. I was lucky though. Before leaving, we had to deal with some crisis'. Many of the youth who live at our center ride the buses back and forth to school. These buses just stopped running due to the snow. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spokanetransit.com/">STA</a> choose to just drop our youth off at different bus stops or park and rides. I really must say that this made me very angry. I felt it was so wrong to just leave our kids. Many of them didn't have cell phones, they tried calling us collect because they didn't have any money for a pay phone.</p><p>If you can imagine a young, 13 year old, who doesn't know their way around Spokane. Not having money or a cell phone, and not knowing where she was between where she was dropped off and the center. I can only imagine how afraid some of our kids were. I left before all of our kids had made it back, because I had already been there for 12 hours.</p><p>I was awakened early in the morning, being asked to come in for an extra shift. My car was completely snowed into the parking lot. I decided to take the bus to work, and was lucky enough to catch the last bus that would be running. This bus dropped me off downtown, making my walk only a half hour. The next morning I wasn't so lucky. There where no buses running. Walking to work, meant trudging though the snow for almost one and half hours. I left my house just a little bit after 5:30 in the morning… much too early for my tastes. I would rather get off work that early in the morning then leave for work then. As I was getting ready these two morning, I couldn't help like feeling like I was a soldier suiting up for war. I was getting ready for whatever would happen.</p>

<p>Both trudging thought the snow to work, hearing my coworkers experiences during the snow, and seeing how willing to help many of my coworkers were made me think about something. With the CRC being a non-profit, non of us get paid very much. I make less now with my BA in Social Work, than I did before I earned my AA degree. I wonder how many of the employes at DSHS would have walked to work. I think there is something about the non-profit community organization sector that instills more passion for the work that they do then is in the public social work sector.</p><p>Please hear me, I'm not saying that people who work for the state, or other such positions are not as passionate for the clients that they work with. I just think that is a different view point from people who work form community-based non-profit organizations then those who work in the public sector. Really, I am just amazed with the people that I work with and the extra hours I see them put in wether or not they get compensated for them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When I got back from Europe, I thought I was done with my backpack for a while. Well, now that it's Christmas time I figured it was ok to pick it back up. This year, I ended up working the whole week of Christmas (including Christmas and and the Eve) and I was sorely ready to head home and see friends and family for the holidays. I decided because of the amount of snowfall, that I might take the Train. This turned out to be a bad idea.</p><p>I got a call the night I was supposed to leave to head back to the Tri-Cities, from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amtrak.com/">Amtrak</a>. They told me that my train was running behind schedule and that would have to take a bus that they chartered. I did not realize that this would cut my weekend short.</p><p>Packed up my backpack, and headed out the door for a <a target="_blank" href="http://g.co/maps/ggcsj">cold early morning walk downtown</a>. I had decided that leaving my car would be the best thing, because of the limited parking next to to the train station. When I arrived at the the train station at about 2 am, I only had to wait about an hour for my bus to get ready to leave. Trading a train ride for a bus ride was not my favorite idea, but I figured at least it would get me home.</p><p>I got to spend the day with my mom and Gary. That night I went to Crossview Community Church's Winter Chill Concert. It was pretty fun, and ended up hanging out playing <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nertz">Nertz</a> until 3 am. I also got another call from Amtrak. They left a voicemail stating that my service was canceled, and that there was no other services set up. I was lucky enough to be able to find a ride back to Spokane from a friend. Generally my entire experience with Amtrak this winter was was stupid and cut my already short trip home even shorter.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I truly believe that God comes and speaks to us though nature often. I don't know how often I see something, and I'm just stuck by the view of it. The picture is of the snow on my garage. It warmed up today, and lots of the snow has melted. It has left ice and water in its wake. As I was standing outside, I was struck by how the snow looked on top of the room. Depreciated was the word that came to mind. Yesterday, it was full. The snow didn't have blemishes, or weakness. It was brimming over the edges of all the buildings. One could almost say that it was overflowing. Now that has changed. The image really doesn't capture (maybe I shouldn't have relied on my cell phone).</p><p>It is like the snow has been filled with little pits. It looks almost weak and defeated. No offense to elderly people, but it almost looks like muscle that has atrophied. I saw this, and realized in some senses, this was how I felt. I feel as if I have lost some of the fire, the vigor of life.

      <title>Do You Really Understand</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/1/do-you-really-understand</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever heard numbers, and wondered really what they mean. People say that they will be there or do something in a second, for things that are to be done relatively soon (i.e. like 10 minutes or less). I’ve talked to people in juvenile detention, or jail who say that they are only there for a minute, when they might mean a couple of months. Along the same lines, I have heard people say that “it will never be ok,” when the problem might seem miniscule in the view of our whole life.</p>

<p>The fact is, that numbers can be hard to understand and people might mean different things with them. This becomes especially true when talking about the large amounts of money. For example, Washington State has a <a href="http://www.governor.wa.gov/priorities/budget/faq.asp" title="Governer Budget FAQs">$6 billion shortfall</a>. The United States trade deficit is about <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/monthly.html" title="$40.4 billion">$40.4 billion</a>. The bailout of the US economy could range upwards of <a href="http://www.infowars.net/articles/october2008/151008Bailout_figures.htm" title="Total Bailout Cost Heads Towards $5 TRILLION">$5 Trillion</a>.</p>

<p>The question is, do people really understand how much that money is. I am not in this post making an argument for or against any type of bailout I just want people to understand how much money these numbers are. When somebody starts talking about numbers in this range, it becomes difficult to comprehend how much that really is and their exponential growth from lesser numbers.</p>

<p>For this example, if you could imagine somebody dropping a single dollar every second into a bottomless pit (I created a flash video that does just this, see below), the following would be how long it would take for the following numbers.</p>

<ul>
<li>For <strong>$100</strong> (one hundred) it would take <strong>1 minute 40 seconds</strong></li>
<li>For <strong>$1,000</strong> (one thousand) it would take <strong>16 minutes 40 seconds</strong></li>
<li>For <strong>$1,000,000</strong> (one million) it would take <strong>11 hours 13 minutes and 47 seconds</strong></li>
<li>For <strong>$1,000,000,000</strong> (one billion) it would take <strong>31 years 249 days 1 hour 46 minutes and 40 seconds</strong></li>
<li>For <strong>$1,000,000,000,000</strong> (one trillion) it would take <strong>316 centuries 88 years 32 days 1 hour 46 minutes and 40 seconds</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Working with a diverse population requires the social worker examine aspects that make up the population. To fully examine a population, a few of the aspects that should be researched are as follows; best practices for working with the population, cultural background, tradition, norms and values, history of oppression, types of support, family dynamics, spirituality, and body language. The stories that fill Humes book come and address each of these aspects at different points.</p><p>Humes (1999) was granted unprecedented access to the juvenile courts in California. The juvenile court system is closed to outsiders and often seems secretive. The juvenile court system encompasses a large number of youth. In California there are 30,000 juvenile delinquency cases brought to court each year, 26 juvenile detention camps with some 4,400 youth, and 8,700 juvenile prison wards. The courts only have four basic sentences they can give to juveniles; (1) HOP (home of parent); (2) suitable placement (a network of public and private foster homes); (3) juvenile detention camps; (4) juvenile prison. This gives only limited options to how a judge can sentence a delinquent youth.</p><p>Humes book describes the various aspects of the Californian juvenile justice system. It moves around the stories of seven different teenagers involved in the court system. He also has in-depth look some different judges, their views and court rooms. Along with the judges he provides stories that involve attorneys, probation officers, youth, delinquents, families, social workers, teachers, and many others that come and go though the lives of the teenagers. It is all set up in story lines that intertwine together to give the reader a picture of court system.</p><p>To read the full review of <a target="_blank" href="/resources/articles/juveniles-involved-in-the-justice-system">Humes 1999 book and working with juvenile offenders</a>&nbsp;or check out my <a href="/resources">resources</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>It's All Relative</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/marko_calasan_mini_mozart_of_c.php" title="Marko Calasan: Mini Mozart of Computers">Marko Calasan: Mini Mozart of Computers</a> is a story about an eight year old kid who has become the worlds youngest IT Professional. He passed the Microsoft Certified System Administrator exam. This means that he would be qualified to administer some business' Microsoft based network.</p>

<p>This made me think about how relative it all is. Comparatively to a lot of people my age, and especially older, I would say that I have above average knowledge in regards to computers. Computers are only my hobby, so I must say I don't know all that much. I have been turned to by my mom on lots occasions to fix minor issues with her computer. I even showed her how to text message. But I have been frequently blow away by what the younger generation knows about computers. This young boy showcases this to the fullest extent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Ever Wonder How You Can Play Video Games and Get Paid</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/6/ever-wonder-how-you-can-play-video-games-and-get-paid</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/539d3106e4b021927576ba61/1402810652352/games-mental-health.jpggames-mental-health?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>I'm not much really much of a gamer. I own a <a href="http://us.playstation.com/ps3/">Playstation 3</a>, but it hasn't been plugged into my TV for probably almost a year. I did enjoy playing <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/IV/">Grand Theft Auto IV</a> and <a href="http://assassinscreed.ubi.com/en-US/home/index.aspx">Assassin's Creed</a>.  I recently listened to In Social Works podcast with <a href="http://www.insocialwork.org/episode.asp?ep=144">Michael Langlois: Gamer-Affirmative Practice: Today's Play Therapy</a>.</p>

<p>Mike Langlois has a blog called <a href="http://gamertherapist.com/blog/">Gamer Therapist</a>. While I'm not super interested in video games specifically, I have for a long time been interested in the interaction between mental health treatment and technology. The reason I originally bought a mac is wanting to learn how to create some iPad apps related to mental health treatment. While I still haven't learned Objective C (well, now it would be better to pursue <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">SWIFT</a>), my practice has been greatly been improved by technology.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I'm going to bring my playstation into the office anytime soon and start implementing it my practice. It is an interesting avenue to pursue and look into.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Whew for a Moment... Now for the Next Step</title>
      <link>/blog/2009/1/whew-for-a-moment-now-for-the-next-step</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two other group members and myself have been working tirelessly on a research project. We are doing an effectiveness study of the <a href="http://yfaconnections.org/" title="Crisis Residential Center’s Direction Program">Crisis Residential Center’s Direction Program</a>. It’s a fairly intensive project. We went though and looked at former client files, are sending out surveys to both the former clients and their legal guardian, and going to preform some in-depth interviews with former clients. We spent all last quarter examining what we were going to do with our project, exploring the literature, and defining our methodology. We also had to get approval from the <a href="http://access.ewu.edu/Grants/Human-Subjects.xml" title="EWU Institutional Review Board">Institutional Review Board</a>. Many a night was spent into the wee hour hours of the morning working on the papers for this. We’ve really wanted to present an excellent product. We are even planning to attempt to get this research published.</p>

<p>The Institutional Review Board took longer than we expected to allow us to go forward with our project. Between going over the various documents ourselves, then with our teacher, then with the board we had seven different versions. We submitted the application four times to the board. I am truly proud of my group members for not giving up, it’s been a long process. That long process, while we have met a milestone is not yet complete. Last week we finally sent out the survey’s, but we still have a lot to do. Now we will have to gather and analyze all of the data. After tuning in our project for class, it will also be a long process to format and submit our research to various journals. For now I am just excited that we have sent out the survey’s.</p>

<p>On an even more geeky note (although, there is not much more geeky than doing research) I thought I’d share about my new backgrounds for both my <a href="http://www.hp.com/united-states/campaigns/touchsmart/#/TouchSmart-Tx2" title="HP Touch Smart">computer</a> and my <a href="http://phones.verizonwireless.com/blackberry/storm2/" title="BlackBerry Storm 2">BlackBerry</a>. found my newest background for my PC a while ago (I tend to change it semi frequently) somewhere... I don’t remember where. You can see it below. I decided that I would make my PC and my BlackBerry match, so I created a similar background for my phone. Fun with Photoshop.</p>

      <title>Cultural Awareness</title>

"/>  Sign Inside of  Zola's . [/caption] 
  

<p>The image is of a sign inside of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zolaspokane.com/">Zola's</a>. I went there with a couple of friends on Friday night. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Milonga/82925234414?sk=info">The Band Milonga</a>, was playing. I must say that I was super excited to hear them play. They are excellent. Not only do they have great music, it's very danceable and they seem to have a following of dancers that go where they go. It makes for a great experience. This is even more true, when you haven't been able to go out dancing in a long time. Dance is something that I have been missing for almost a year. My life has just been too hectic to really fit it in, even when it is one of my stress relievers. It is also one of my connections to other cultures (especially the when talking about Latin dancing). I am hoping that going dancing this weekend with spur me to make more time for it coming up.</p><p>This week, has been kind of a look into cultural awareness. I found myself talking to the kids at my work during group the last two times I've led it on being culturally aware. I think that it is a very important concept for them to understand. We talked about it some, when I went out with some friends for valentines day. A couple of people that I am going to Peru with, some other friends, and myself all went to Applebees last night. It always nice to hang out with fellow social workers.</p><p>This morning when I woke up, and was actually able to make it to church (I've missed too much church lately) the topic was about cultural awareness (generally). I was struck by a skit that was preformed at the beginning of service. It was all about the concept of white privilege, and other race related issues. It actually reminded me of being in some of my social work classes. It also made me happy that my church has their perspective so right on. I don't think my church puts videos of the various skits that they preform, but if they do I'll post it later. In thinking about this, it made me remember a paper I wrote. It's my ethnic autobiography. the following is an excerpt from it;</p><p>As a white protestant male, I am a member of the dominate culture in the United State. Growing up I never had to question if somebody was doing certain actions because of my ethnicity. I never had any difficulty finding people who looked like me, and being able to be accepted into a group. I never really thought about my skin color or my racial background. My mom never had to explain about my Germanic heritage, or did I ever wonder about cultural practices. All of these where vary far removed from my growing up experiences growing up.</p><p>You can read the rest of the essay I wrote: <a href="/resources/articles/ethnicity-non-ethnicity">The Ethnicity of Non-Ethnicity: The Ethnic Autobiography of the Dominate Culture</a></p><p>Now, I have to run and go to work. It took a lot longer than I was expecting to put all this together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="http://freakonomics.com/">Freakonomics</a> recently had an episode of their podcast, <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2014/01/30/reasons-to-not-be-ugly-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/">Reasons to Not Be Ugly</a>. The episode looks at beauty, and how it effects peoples lives from being a cute baby to working and marriage relationships in adulthood. It was pretty interesting.</p><p>It made me think about how fussy people are for Mateo. When I take him to the store and other public locations, people are always fussing over him and saying how cute he is. This helps me to justify my feelings and bias that Mateo is by far one of the cutest babies out there.</p>

<p>If you had previously asked me how to tell the attractiveness of an individual, I would not have guessed that facial symmetry would be a good way to identify attractiveness. I decided that I needed to have a more objective way of measuring both my and Mateo's attractiveness. For Mateo, he scored a 7.37 (although I would say he should be higher and I just didn't put the points accurately). It is still a good score, especially for somebody who still has a lot of growth to happen. I used, <a href="http://www.anaface.com">Ana face</a>'s Facial Beauty Analysis. I ended up uploading one of my pictures, but it did not turn out that I was nearly as cute as Mateo. I will say, that the photo I uploaded was a bit more joking and probably one that doesn't quite do me justice. I'm ok with my score of 3.13. I can rest assured that at least Mateo will not be discriminated against based on his looks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390018418104_73067">Spending only five days working at the PPA is difficult, it really doesn't feel like it is enough. As I sit here Thursday (actually technically Friday) morning, knowing tomorrow will be the last day that I get the opportunity to work with Los Niños de Puericultorio Perez Aranibar (PPA) it is a very sad thought. You see find pictures of Peru~ PPA &amp; Villa El Salvador <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.515252293556.2033999.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=76325748c3" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.515252293556.2033999.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=76325748c3" target="_blank">Peru~ PPA &amp; Villa El Salvador 1 of 2</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.515253645846.2034002.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=238bcf0f0a" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.515253645846.2034002.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=238bcf0f0a" target="_blank" id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390018418104_74051">Peru~ PPA &amp; Villa El Salvador 2 of 2</a>&nbsp;albums on Facebook. Although I will only have been in Peru for 10 days come Saturday, it both feels like an eternity full of activities and thoughts and at the same time merely a touch in the water in regards to getting to know the kids or be of service to them and the PPA.</p><p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390018418104_73070">My mornings at the PPA have been spent doing physical labor. I have really enjoyed this trip having so many different layers to it. My physical labor layer is really nice in the fact almost nobody was willing to do it, knowing how much it's needed around the huge campus of the PPA, and getting to see an instant result upon completion. The afternoon's I spend "teaching" English to eight year old. Doing this I haven't been able to see the instant results I get in the mornings. I believe it was one of my fellow travelers, Tony, who said it was like organizing chaos. We have a couple of games, often bring toy animals (asking the kids to describe them in Spanish then giving them the English names), and then playing futból and stopping various skirmishes. Even though I don't believe me and Tony really taught the kids very much English, we got to love on them and give a couple of kids some individual attention they so lack in this institutional setting.<br></p>

<p>Yesterday, it was very powerful to get the opportunity to visit Villa El Salvador, a district in Lima. The main parts of town are nice, paved, and have many beautiful sections. Once you leave the more central areas, one finds how most Lima residents live. Villa El Salvador has dirt roads, no running water, trash in the streets, stinks, extremely poor families, and yet happy beautiful people. Seeing people's resilience, regardless of their economic status and living conditions really puts your own life into status. It was a hard day, knowing that many of the kids at the PPA come from homes like the ones we visited in Villa El Salvador is really hard.</p><p>We visited one home, with one of PPA's social workers. This visit was to check in with the family. We found a 12 year old daughter cooking for her younger siblings while her mom was at work. After getting back to Mira Flores (the wealthy district we have been staying in) we went back to the PPA to read bedtime stores to the three year old and tuck them in. It was so hard for many of us to leave these precious children. Feeling the weight of the day, I figured it was important to be able to debrief and relax. The trip has been strenuous.</p><p>Me and a friend bought some Peruvian wine, Cuban cigars (just had too, because they are illegal in the states), and Peruvian cheese and chocolate. About six of us stayed up talking until almost one am about all the things we've seen and experienced. It was powerful to just sit and get out many of the things we were all thinking about. Anyways, it is getting late and I have to get up very early for my last day at the PPA.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I spent this weekend seeing old friends in both Pulman and Moscow. It was a really good time, and a trip well spent. The trip really made me spend some time evaluating where I am in my life, especially as I sped home at 2 am on Sunday morning (wanted to be able to go to my home church).</p><p>I had two thoughts as I was speeding home. I started thinking about how fast paced my life (and really the majority of the industrialized world) is. First, I was thought about when the road is bumpy that one feels the bumps even more and they can be harder to handle then if somebody is going slowly. Have you ever taken a speed bump at 50 mph? Well, I haven't, but I would imagine that it would be very hard to take. I think this is true in our lives too. As our life pace moves so quickly, the bumps in our life are harder to handle correctly. It is much more likely that one of the bumps in our life will take us out. Second, I started thinking about how I drive when I am going fast, especially at night. Race cars attempt to turn as little as possible. Sudden changes in direction can be detrimental for somebody going quickly. If there are no cars, I might freely change lanes back and forth to attempt to go as straight as possible. It's like the lines in our life don't matter as much. I believe in our fast paced life, it can be easier and easier to have the lines and boundaries blur. Things that did not appear cross-able are easily crossed to keep the speed up. Maybe it's time to slow our lives down some, keep in our lane and courageously take on all the bumps that come our way.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Transitions and ceremony are important aspects of all of our lives. I was talking with a good friend the other day, who was telling me that she is not that interested in a wedding. To me the marriage is not about either the certificate or the ceremony. I do believe that both are important. The certificate is like a legal deceleration stating to everybody that two people are married. The ceremony is also important in that it is a public display of of what is going on in two people's hearts and a public showing of the certificate. While the most important component of the marriage is the two people and their lives lived together, the other parts are significant.</p><p>In the western culture, we don't truly have a ceremony to depict a young person's transition into adulthood. Many cultures used to have different ceremonies. Last year, I was hoping to attend one of Fr. Richard Rohr's <a href="#">Men's Rites of Passage</a>&nbsp;I will be participating in my own right of passage today. Graduation from college is probably the closest ceremony that we have depicting somebodies transition into adulthood.</p><p>Today, I will graduate with my master's degree in social work. It is a pretty amazing story that while it took five years to earn my high school diploma, I will have earned my master's degree in the same amount of time. I have had a ton of different challenges, changes, and other stuff happen over the last many years and find myself lucky to be where I'm at.</p><p>While I am still not exactly sure what I will be doing next year this time… I do have have some ideas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I've been told a number of times that I should write a book. When I tell people about my hopes and dreams, I often list a great number of things. Things like get my Ph.D., start a commune (ask me about this, I like talking about it), starting a private practice, teaching at a university (I did do this when I was in Peru, but I want to teach Social Work or something equivalent), being a keynote speaker, traveling more, starting my own non-profit... etc. Writing a / some book(s) is always on that list.</p><p>When people have told me that I should write a book, they are always talking about something related to my dad and my story related to him and my struggles (sometimes about my <a href="/blog?tag=Travel">travel adventures too</a>). I guess I've always figured that I would do something equivalent, but not really until further in the future. When I have thought about writing a book about my dad (Charles Rodman Campbell, <a href="/testimony">you can read my story</a>), I've imagined it more focused on my life. A couple of months ago, was thinking about this and started imagining it differently.</p><p>I tend to always have to have a title for something before I can really start writing it, at least that was my experience at University. The working title that I have come up with for my book would be something similar to "Not a Monster: The Story of a Convicted and Executed Murder."</p><p>My perspective has changed a little bit. I'd like to write a book that connects more to my father's life. I think this a powerful way to tell the story. I've watched a couple of seasons of Dexter, and really enjoy it as a series. The premise of the story is about a serial killer who works for the police department as a blood spatter analyst, but really is himself a serial killer. He only kills those who have killed themselves. A funny thing happens as you watch <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_(TV_series)">Dexter</a>. He becomes the hero, and somebody that you come to love. I remember being blown away by how much you can be rooting for the bad guy (most people would say that a serial killer is a bad guy. There are several other series' that do something similar (another good one is <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad">Breaking Bad</a>) and books (for example <em><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked:_The_Life_and_Times_of_the_Wicked_Witch_of_the_West">Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West</a></em>, which I want to read but haven't yet).</p><p>I guess as I've been thinking about my dad, I'm wanting to do something like this. To tell his story in a way that recognizes how heinous his crimes were, but that comes to appreciate the person that he was. I never thought of my father as a killer or somebody bad (even though we didn't always get along). He was always just my dad and somebody that I loved. I'd like to share that perspective with the world.</p><p>I also think that it will be a really great way for me to know more about my dad. Many of my memories are flawed and missing information. As my mom, Minnie and I were driving back from visiting family last week, we spent a lot of the car ride talking about my dad. The memories of a young child aren't very reliable, and I'd like to know more about my dad's past and who he was. I think that other people would find it to be a compelling story. I'm hoping to be able to talk to some of my family on my dad's side. I don't know very many people on his side. It has been interesting over the years, because I've been contacted by many people who knew my dad through this website. This book might give me a good opportunity to follow up with them.</p><p>Let me know what you think.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been a busy couple of weeks at work. I've been burning the midnight oil the last couple of weeks. We've had lots of changes happening at our agency. We've had three case managers change their positions in the last couple of months. My case load has increased by about 20 clients, with new ones being add almost daily it seems. I've been doing a lot of intakes at the Juvenile for my work, which has been good but also busy.This weekend, I got the opportunity to attend my fourth annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.childrensalliance.org/news-events/have-heart-kids-day-2012-legislative-session">Have A Heart for Kids Day</a>][5]. I've been searching through my blog posts from previous years, trying to find out if I've written about my experiences for Have a Heart for Kids Day before, but I was unable to find anything.</p><p>It all started in the first year of my BASW program while I was at Eastern. Every year for a while, the EWU Social Work program used to bring a group of students to participate in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.childrensalliance.org/">Children's Alliances'</a>&nbsp;Lobby Day, named "Have a Heart for Kids Day." They would bring us up in a bus or van, put us up in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.olywagov.com/">Governor Hotel</a>. The next morning we would go to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theunitedchurches.org/">The United Churches of Olympia's</a>&nbsp;facility right next to the capital building. There we would have some key note speaker who would talk about Children's Alliance, a legislative advocacy group for children in Washington. We would break up into workshops and hear more in-depth about some of that year's legislative issues around children. We would talk about effective advocating to our legislators. We would then march to the capitol steps and chanting and hold signs. After the march, we would break up and go and give letters and try to talk to our legislators. It's always been a pretty great event.</p><p>Last year after getting back from <a target="_blank" href="/blog/?tag=Jaunt+Down+South+2010">South America</a>, I had called up the School of Social Work, and made plans to meet up with them there. I ended up <a target="_blank" href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/">Couch Surfing</a>&nbsp;for the first night, then staying in a motel the second night due to the pass being closed with snow.</p><p>This year, Minnie and I decided to go ourselves. I tried to connect with the EWU students, but I'm not sure if they went this year. It was a powerful experience, as usual. I ended up having a early morning meeting with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/senate/senators/Pages/delvin.aspx">Senator Jerome Delving</a>.</p><p>Being so close to Puyallup, we also went to Minnie's sister's house and got to stay with them. It was a pretty great experience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How's Your Mental Efficiency, a Review of Arnold Bennett's Book</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/2/hows-your-mental-efficiency-a-review-of-arnold-bennetts-book</link>

<p>My mom and I have a long tradition of listening to books on tape (well, really I guess they were CD’s mostly) when we would travel. When Minnie and I were driving back from Olympia this weekend, we continued this tradition. We listened to <em><a target="_blank" href="http://goo.gl/uP1vr">Mental efficiency, and other hints to men and women</a></em>&nbsp;by Arnold Bennett. Really, I think it is more of a collection of essays, but he has proven to be a timeless writer even with more than 100 years between its first being published and now.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Bennett">Arnold Bennett</a>&nbsp;was an English journalist and author who died in March of 1931. He wrote on a great number of different topics, and at least with this edition, his very British sense of humor is displayed magnificently.</p><p>The book starts out with an article he wrote about mental efficiency, asking readers how we can train our minds similarly to how we would train our bodies. He then includes some of their own responses along with his own proposal for rectifying mental degradation. He even gives some specific, as he calls them, mental calisthenics. These include writing a diary, writing a journal, contemplating about deep issues, reading and responding to what we have read (a part of why I figured that I should respond to this work in particular), and other activities. The rest of the book seems to be taken up with his own contemplation of some of life’s own issues. These issues pertain to marriage, success, books, and contemplation.</p><p>Bennett’s chapter on books was interesting. He spent a considerable amount of time discussing the degradation of personal libraries due to cheap re-prints of books. This section made me laugh as I had downloaded a free version of his book to listen too, the ultimate in cheap re-prints of books.</p><p>His section on success was also particularly interesting. As he did throughout his book, he used a number of partially well put together analogies to give thought to his points. He described one form of success as though it was through a game of roulette. This is a description that I find highly beneficial. He argued his case only a very small minority obtained acclaimed success due strictly to talent. While he did not directly relate this to the mentality of pulling oneself up by their bootstraps, I find it apt at arguing the same point. In my field of work, this is something that I frequently see. The fact that many people are trying to make it, but it’s really often times like a game of roulette whether or not they make it.</p><p>All in all, I would say that it is a good and timely read. It is a book that you can <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23347">download for free from Gutenberg Project</a>&nbsp;or even find a free audio book download as I did.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am very lucky at <a href="/blog?tag=TCCH%20BHS">my job</a>, to be able to be a part of a some community organizing. &nbsp;I have started to be involved with meetings associated with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dshs.wa.gov/pdf/dbhr/Pasco%20PRI%20Brochure-%20Final.pdf">Pasco Discovery Coalition</a>. &nbsp;I've just started, so I am very much in the learning phase of participating in their coalition, but I believe it will be a valuable learning experience. &nbsp;While we were at our last meeting, they had mentioned that somebody was working on a website for them, and it got me thinking about a logo. &nbsp;Teresa (the current co-chair) described that she has been using geese flying in a "V" formation as their logo. &nbsp;She said that it was based on how birds will have different birds fly as the lead bird at different times, and how much better they are are able to fly together.</p><p>Nobody had asked me to make a Logo, and I am not even sure if they really need one, but I like pushing myself and learning a little bit more about graphic design, so I decided to throw some of these designs out there. &nbsp;I wouldn't call any of them finished products, but it was interesting for me to work on. &nbsp;Some of them I like, some of them I don't (I posted all of them, so you could see my design process).</p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

<p>I'm currently helping out at my agency, <a href="/blog?tag=TCCH%20BHS">Nueva Esperanza Community Counseling Services</a>, with a working group redesigning out treatment plan that we use with our client. &nbsp;It's been a good process and I think something important to consider. &nbsp;In participating in this process, I have been thinking about how we develop strengths. &nbsp;I decided that since I was thinking about strengths perspective, I should put up some information in my <a href="/resources">resources section</a>.</p><p>I also recently finished reading a copy of Tom Roth's Strengths Finder 2.0 (make sure to check out all of my other <a href="/blog?tag=Book%20Review">book reviews</a>). &nbsp;I'd recommend the book, but I will acknowledge that it takes some homework time to really gain any significance from it.</p><p>To really get the most out of Strengths Finder 2.0, you must purchase a new copy of the book (or a book that has an unused access code for their website). &nbsp;The book really is only supplemental, and I felt like it was almost like a sales pitch for their web program to examine individuals strengths. &nbsp;The majority of the learning I accomplished seemed to come from using their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.strengthsfinder.com/home.aspx">Clifton Strengths Finder</a>. &nbsp; This is basically an assessment that attempts to help you discover what strengths and assets you have have though choosing answers on a web based form.</p><p>I did find the results to be valuable, and informative. &nbsp;I also really appreciated hearing about a strengths perspective from a different source (i.e. not just about mental health, but seeing the value in the business / personal life). &nbsp;It's been an interesting couple of months reading (don't worry, it didn't take me a couple of months to finish this book, as it's quite small). &nbsp;I've also been reading Plato's The Republic. &nbsp;While I haven't finished, I hope to within the next couple of weeks, so you can look forward to a review of that book too. &nbsp;But to give you a small look forward, I've been amazed how many theories and modern ideas are espoused in Plato's work, including strengths perspective.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Hard for the Economy as For Individuals</title>
      <link>/blog/2012/9/hard-for-the-economy-as-for-individuals</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I was listening to an article on <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a>'s <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/">Planet Money</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/09/14/161153421/even-if-youre-all-powerful-its-hard-to-fix-the-economy">Even If You're All-Powerful, It's Hard To Fix The Economy</a>.The article was all about how difficult it really would be to fix the economy. Using a computer generated model of the United States economy, they try to change various variables associated with the economy to improve it. What they find is that regardless of how many variables they change and how drastically they change those variables... it never gets back as good as it was. It makes me think of the work I do with some of my clients. Often times, when people have psychotic episodes and their mental health deteriorates, they won't come back to their original baseline of functioning. This is not to say that when somebody experiences a new psychotic break that they can't improve. But it is like they lose their ability to get back to the same normal that they once had. I guess it is the same for the economy. It almost like in both of those systems, too many things become broken and it becomes very difficult to get back to the same level you were at before.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In my second year at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.columbiabasin.edu/">Columbia Basin College</a>&nbsp;earning my AA Transfer Degree, I remember being in stress management class. I believe it was the first time that I was exposed to what I have heard over and over in my professional life regarding stress. He discussed a concept of clustering. This could be referred to as chronic or complex stress. This clustering is when an individual experiences a number of stressful events all near the same time period. Both in my life story and so much more in my experience working in mental health over the years, I can really see the truth and frequency that clustering happens.</p><p>Over and over in my interactions with my clients, I’ve heard them discuss complex stress even when they don’t understand it as such and only see it as a matter of their daily lives. Working with Medicaid clients and the severely chronically mentally ill at <a target="_blank" href="http://mytcch.org/">Tri-Cities Community Health</a>’s Behavior Health Services Department (<a href="/blog?tag=TCCH%20BHS">Neuva Esperanza Community Counseling Services</a>), unscientifically I would propose that majority of our clients are experiencing the most complex trauma and stress. In thinking about it, I realistically don’t have any client who is only experiencing one major concern in their lives. Their lives tend to be series’ of crises and other problems. As a clinician, it can often times be difficult to discern what their underlying needs are or what issue to work on first.</p><h2>Life and Its Constant Search for Balance</h2>

<p>On Saturday, October 13 Minnie and I were at Tony Romas celebrating the life growing inside of Minnie and getting ready for our baby boy that is expected to come in January 2013. We were completely focused on celebration prep and all of the friends and family that would be attending. I made these pretty snazzy invitations in <a data-cke-saved-href="/blog?tag=Adobe%20Illustrator" href="/blog?tag=Adobe%20Illustrator">Adobe Illustrator</a>.</p>

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1390367125423_44735">We were preparing for a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/435036266534789/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/events/435036266534789/" target="_blank">baby shower</a>&nbsp;and had both of our families and friends from all over to celebrate at Tony Romas restaurant and to give us baby gifts because we didn't have anything. As we were celebrating this new upcoming life, we had no idea that Minnie’s mother would pass away in a little over a week. You can check out the photo album, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.705530664176.2100319.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=e976655960" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.705530664176.2100319.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=e976655960" target="_blank">It’s a Boy! Family &amp; Friends Baby Shower</a>, on Facebook. During the baby shower, we had everybody participate in an activity where the guests wrote pieces of advice on a note card for Minnie and I. I really thought this was a cool idea, and wanted to find a great way to share them with everybody. I made a picture collage and a flash object.</p>

You can also see the Facebook album. It was inspired by playing around with  Google's Picasa Program &nbsp;I realized that I couldn't make all of the changes I wanted to, so I ended up making it in Photoshop. The Photoshop tools I utilized were pretty basic. Over all of the individual cards, I added a stroke, some inner shadow and some drop shadow. To add a title to the picture, I used a square shape with stroke and pattern overlay. The text of the title just has some drop shadow and utilizes Bradly Hand font. I've also  uploaded the PSD file ][49] so you can better see what I did.

<p>The day after the baby shower, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000936035087">Teresa Garcia</a>, Minnie’s mom went ended up going back to the hospital. She had fallen a couple of weeks before, but had not been improving even under her doctors care. While there was a lot of different factors and things that happened, all of which I’m not going to share here, her mother ended up in the Intensive Care Unit at Kadlec Hospital being sustained by life supportive machines. For over a week, Minnie was at the Hospital all day every day with her family and friends. After I would get off work, I’d head to spend time at the hospital too. This gave us a lot of different things to think about and consider.</p><p>She and her family had to make decisions about what quality of life is and what her, Teresa Garcia’s, desires would be given her living situation. It was not an easy week with a myriad of other things that came up and difficult situations. Last Monday (10/22/12) the family made the decision to take Minnie’s mother off of life support and she passed away several hours after that. You can see her <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yakimaherald.com/news/obituaries/latestdeathnotices/450832-13/teresa-m-garcia">death notice</a>&nbsp;and her <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yakimaherald.com/news/obituaries/451970-13/teresa-mendez-garcia">obituary</a>&nbsp;in the Yakima Herald.</p><p>I took the rest of that week off to be able to be supportive and to help with the arrangements. During this time, we were asked to move in with her father and help to support him in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosser,_WA">Prosser Washington</a>. We packed up all of our stuff and put two thirds of it into a storage unit in Pasco and moved the rest of it to their ranch. This week, I’ve been back a work but it’s been hard to catch back up. Other then moving and all sorts of other crazy stuff... I also got my wisdom teeth pulled (all four of them).</p>

  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>Come along as we live out this conversation . . . there are many obstacles—so much suffering, poverty and violence. But our God is familiar with suffering. Our God can swallow up armies and pour out bread from the heavens. Wall Street may fail us, but the God who takes care of the lilies and the sparrows will never let us down. Our Savior has stared evil in the face and overcome it with love. And now we are invited to join the triumph of the cross . . . and to lead others on the narrow, rugged road to freedom.<span>&#148;</span>

<p><br />I have really been inspired and encouraged by <a href="#">Shane Claiborn</a>, and you can read my other book review <a target="_blank" href="/blog/2011/12/a-look-into-joining-the-irresistible-revolution">A Look into Joining the Irresistible Revolution</a>. While, I am somewhat familiar with Shane and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thesimpleway.org/">Simple Way</a>&nbsp;(the intentional community Shane is involved with), I had not heard of John Perkins before. Interestingly enough, Jamie, my <a href="/blog?tag=TCCH%20BHS">co-worker</a>&nbsp;who lent me a copy of this <a href="/blog?tag=Audio%20Book">audio book</a>&nbsp;does know him.</p><p>As I am living a considerable distance from work, read my blog post <a target="_blank" href="/blog/2012/11/when-it-rains-it-pours">When it Rains it Pours</a>&nbsp;for some more information surrounding my move to <a href="/blog?tag=Prosser%20Washington">Prosser</a>, I was able to listen to the whole book in just a little over a week. During my car ride, it monopolized my time, not even leaving very much space for my normally appreciated <a href="/blog?tag=National%20Public%20Radio">National Public Radio</a>&nbsp;listening Fervor. I came to find out later about the week (I believe that’s how long she said, but it might have been considerably longer) that spent with John Perkins. She talked about how her time spent with John challenged her perspectives on life and even influenced her later decision to move into the impoverished and underserved community of East Pasco. I also found out from her that he is an 82 year old advocate.</p><p>I didn’t read the book itself, so I am not sure how it flowed in its conversational format, but it seemed perfect for the audio format. It’s really structured as more of a conversation between Shane and John and goes back and forth between the two. I’m actually curious how the book displays the differences in voices that were so easily displayed by the portraying authors’ voices.</p><p>There were a number of really emboldening stories, [deep thoughts][18], topics that are import to me (<a href="/blog?tag=Community">community</a>, <a href="/resources?tag=Leadership">leadership</a>, how to follow, <a href="/blog?tag=Politics">politics</a>, etc.). Many of the topics addressed came back to relationship and community and how to do community development. The organization, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ccda.org/">Christian Community Development Association</a>, came up a number of times. It really spoke to me in my position as the chairperson of the <a href="/blog?tag=Pasco%20Discovery%20Coalition">Pasco Discovery Coalition</a>. Some of the methods of organizing these movements, the foundational inclusion of what they call indigenous leaders were all such promising topics. Now it will be trying to figure out how to help guide our coalition in that direction.</p><p>I would highly recommend this book, especially in its audio book format for any reader.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>New and Fun Functionality</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/1/new-and-fun-functionality</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've always been a little bit of a geek. That's actually a little bit of why I've created this website in the first place... so that I could show off my geekyness a little bit. More than just knowing how to use computers at a slightly higher proficiency than average, I love all things technology. Every morning, I find myself getting a hot cup of coffee, sitting outside in the cold with my iPad reading the news and having a cigarette (I know it's bad for my health, but I do truly love those moments). I use&nbsp;<a href="http://news.google.com/">Google News</a>&nbsp;you can even read the blog post I wrote about it a couple of years ago,&nbsp;<a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2008/10/now-you-can-read-what-im-reading">Now You Can Read What I'm Reading</a>.</p><p>With my commute having gotten longer, I've also been listening to Podcasts to take up some of the time. I've written a couple of articles about the&nbsp;<a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/tags/freakonomics">Freakonomics Podcast</a>that I've been listening to. I've added to my collection of digital media to subscribe to, and have started also listening to the&nbsp;<a href="http://lifehacker.com/the-show/">Life Hacker Podcast</a>&nbsp;which doesn't have exactly as great of production quality as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/">the Freakonomics Podcast</a>&nbsp;does, but it does have some great content.</p><p>One cool thing that I have started to implement due to listening to LifeHacker is using a really cool service called&nbsp;<a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>&nbsp;(i.e. If This Than That). It's a really neat service which automates a number of activities that we do online. For example, now, whenever I change my profile picture on my&nbsp;<a href="http://fb.com/jacobshouse">Facebook Account</a>&nbsp;it will change my profile picture in my&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/campjacob">@campjacob Twitter Account</a>. Because my Twitter account has been pretty left out of the loop in things and left under appreciated, it seems like a pretty cool service and I don't have to do anything. There are tons of really cool automated activities you can have it do. These include anything from notifying you via SMS if there the CDC updates a zombie outbreak to a really useful service I am also using that makes when I post on my Instagram Account that it also posts the picture on Twitter with the image uploaded to Twitter so it actually shows up in my profile and not just the link which is what has been happening recently. I'm trying out a new feature which will hopefully post every one time I post a new blog post or image post or resources post it will also share that with my various social networking sites. All in all, I think it pays a little bit to be a bit of a geek.</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Review of David Sparks's Markdown Book  an Investigation to Formatting Documents</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/3/review-of-david-sparkss-markdown-book-an-investigation-to-formatting-documents</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p><p>With the <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2014/2/adventures-unexpected-going-ipad-only">hard drive on my MacBook Pro out of commission</a>, and that over the last year I've completely changed how I manage data storage, I figured it was time to write a review of <a href="http://macsparky.com">David Sparks </a>'s <a href="http://macsparky.com/fieldguides/">Field Guide</a> <a href="http://macsparky.com/markdown/">Markdown</a> (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/markdown/id622433972?mt=11">buy it iTunes</a>).</p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1000.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/53137bbee4b00ae8705eaeb9/1393785807407/image.jpg" alt="  Book Cover for David Sparks's Field Guide: Markdown.  "/>   Book Cover for David Sparks's Field Guide: Markdown.  [/caption] 
  

<p>I wrote really briefly about Markdown in my post, <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2013/6/been-so-long">Been So Long</a>. I've been transitioning most all of my documents into plain text files. For the non plain text nerds out there, this might sound a little strange. In my viewpoint, there is a real case to be made for plain text files:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Space</strong>: Plain text files take up almost no space on your hard drive, can be stored easily and quickly in the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Size</strong>: Even on my MacBook Pro, <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/">Microsoft Word</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/pages/">Apple Pages</a> (although Pages seems to load significantly faster and I really prefer it), documents take time to load. Text files are so small and simple, it loads almost instantly.</li>
<li><strong>Search-ability</strong>: With programs like <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT</a>, I can easily find and edit all of my text files, even if they are just small little snippets of information, I can find it quickly and easily.</li>
<li><strong>Survivability</strong>: File formats change. There are a number of word processing files types that I wouldn't have any way of ever opening anymore. Storing files in a plan text file isn't ever going to go away. It's kind of like the very base structure that you can have, so it is easily importable, and exportable and will always be able to be opened.</li>
</ul>

<p>Markdown is almost like a very simple (super simple, really you probably already do it) way of writing that that can be written in plain text and exported into a rich text format. For example if you've ever written an "*" or a "-" to make a bulleted list, then that is markdown. It gives you some of the basic features that you might want to use in your writing to help with the formating, but nothing nearly as complex as you can do either in HTML or in a word processing docuement. Many programs can take your plain text file, and export it into a rich text format so that it looks pretty as if you did in a word processer.</p>

<p>John Grubber at <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">Daring Fireball: Markdown Overview</a>, was the one who first created Markdown. There are other syntaxes that are similar in nature for plain text to that of Markdown that have expanded purposes, features, and uses. There is even a syntax called <a href="http://fountain.io">Fountain for writing scripts in</a>. </p>

<p>David and Eddie's book was written in <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/">iBooks Author</a>, and is created and especially for iBooks. That means it has features not normally available to other e-books. Along with the great descriptions, design astetics, it also has hours of audio and video embedded in the e-book. You can also purchase the PDF version and have access to the additional features through David's website. If I've peaked your curiosity, I'd highly recommend downloading the book on your iPad! You should also check out my favorite podcast, <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com">Mac Power Users</a>, in which David is a co-host. I've written about <a href="/?tag=Mac+Power+Users">their show</a> frequently over the several months.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1402127260954_11953">It's been a while since I've posted any family stuff on here, so I figured I needed to put together some recent throwbacks. The last couple of weeks I've had my head down and working on my business. I've been doing more side graphic, logo, website, and other design services. I made a website for my mom's dōTERRA business (<a href="http://www.judydirks.com/" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.judydirks.com/" target="_blank">Judy Dirks, A Guide to Living Well</a>). It's super beautiful and uses a parallax design on the header images and turned out pretty amazing. I made it in <a href="http://www.squarespace.com" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.squarespace.com" target="_blank">Squarespace</a>, and am pretty proud of my work.</p>

<p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1402127260954_13180">I've also put together a website and new logo for my business. I spent a couple of months trying to come up with a name that I felt really worked and wanted. <a href="http://www.squarespace.com" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.squarespace.com" target="_blank">The Design Clinic</a> was the name that I ultimately came up with.</p><p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1402127260954_13798">While, I know that Easter is quite a while ago, but I put together a short little video of Mateo doing his Easter Egg Hunt. He is super cute, you can view it on YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCAVvNZFrfM" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCAVvNZFrfM" target="_blank">Fishies &amp; Eggs -- Easter 2014</a>).</p>

<p>Working in the mental health field when I am working with my clients, I attempt to steer clear of technical jargon. There are times and places that I do use more psychobabble, but if I do use it in session it's coupled with a description in plain English. This is especially relevant for the clientele that we serve at my agency, which is predominately Medicaid clients. Being a community mental health center, a large percentage of my patients tend to be chronically mentally ill, impoverished, and undereducated. It is always important to make sure that what I am teaching, working on / through is understandable. &nbsp;While, in my conversations, I attempt to include the smallest amount of specialized terminology as possible, in my documentation I strive to be as technically accurate as possible. This means that prefer to name things using the most appropriate and specific verbiage.</p><figure >
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>Word Salad: <sub>Noun</sub><br/>A confused or unintelligible mixture of seemingly random words and phrases, specifically (in psychiatry) as a form of speech indicative of advanced schizophrenia.<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>

<p>While I do not profess to be experiencing anything remotely close to word salad or more clinically defined as schizophasia. Realistically, its not even in the same class of thought disorders. The last couple of weeks, I've been noticing that at home I find myself using an excess of opaque non-technological expressions. Very often for me, this means referring to everything as "the thing." For example, I'll ask Minnie  "can you hand me the thing," to which she replies "what thing?" and I realize she has not idea what I'm talking about and say "you know, my water bottle."</p>

<p>For all of us, this is a normal part of speech, and not abnormal one bit. It's very common for all of us to have a word not come instantly to mind, and so we use some sort of filler word. I almost wish that the stock word I absentmindedly choose was something with more novelty like <em>doohickey, thingy-a-bob, dongle, whatchamacallit, widget.. etc</em>, mine is pretty <strong>Plain Jane</strong>. We all use different  placeholder terms. You should read the the list on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placeholder_name">Wikipedia article for placeholder names</a> which has some really interesting ones that I'm trying to figure out how to incorporate into my everyday speech.</p>

<p>The same way, if you are doing public speaking and are attempting to stop saying "Umm" (or more frequently "like" for me personally), that I see myself calling any object a thing. It might be, that I've been thinking about my over use of "thing," but it made me wonder if some of it could be because of my days being spent attempting to be clear, concise, and as accurate as possible. Just maybe, it's as if I save up all my casual phrases and use an abundance whenever I'm away from work.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Podcast Famous, Shout Out on Mac Power Users</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/52ebceaae4b0767f26ae4497/1391185579273/mac-power-users-podcast-logo.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>One of my favorite podcasts to listen to every week is the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.macpowerusers.com">Mac Power Users</a>. I can give credit to their show for the majority of the productivity and ability to best make use of my mac from their show. If you're a apple products user, I'd highly recommend their show, it's pretty amazing. I've sent a couple of emails to the hosts over and have listened to so many of their episodes, I feel like I almost know them. &nbsp;A couple of weeks ago, I responded to a call to talk about how users use <a target="_blank" href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a>. &nbsp;I have been heavily using TextExpander both at home and at work. &nbsp;Looking at my statistics this morning, over the last couple of months, I've saved almost 17 hours of typing time. &nbsp;When I was listening to their show on Monday, riding my bike home, I was surprised and excited to hear them share from my email on the program. &nbsp;I am very sure it was about me, but they said the listener's name was Jared, not Jacob. &nbsp;It's OK, it still made me feel super famous!</p><p>The episode is about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/">GarageBand</a>. &nbsp;It is a pretty cool product. &nbsp;I've played around with it some, but I'm hoping to dive a little more into it after listening to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/2014/01/26/mac-power-users-174-garageband-for-everyone-and-macworld-2014/">the episode</a>. They also talked about Macworld iWorld 2014. &nbsp;I'm actually hoping to be able to go. &nbsp;You should listen to the episode, it was really great.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Adventures Unexpected, Going iPad Only</title>

<p>My life always seems to be full of adventures, or maybe like so many other things, it's only a matter of perspective. Especially when I've been <a href="/blog/?category=Travel+Blog">traveling</a> in the past, I've found my self with <a href="/blog/?tag=Travel+Troubles">all kinds of difficulties</a> and random adventures.</p>

<p>I've been using my MacBook Pro very heavily over the past year and a couple of months since purchased it.  I take it with me to work, and use it there.  I use it for creating <a href="/blog/?tag=Design">graphics and other design projects</a>.  It seems like I'm almost always on it. On Friday, I got home and I was going to keep working on the Keynote presentation I'm making for work regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> and Mental Health on Wednsday.  I had used it prior in the day, and there seemed to be no problems.</p>

<p>When I clicked the on button, there was the happy chime saying that it was starting, but it just never actually started.  After about a half a minute I was accosted by the white screen of death (similar to the blue screen of death on a windows machine I'd imagine).  There in front of me was bright white screen with a blinking folder with a question mark on it.</p>

<p>I purchased my computer at Best Buy and with any large purchase like this, I get a couple of years of Geek Squad protection. It means even if I throw my laptop a cross the room, I can get it replaced for free. &nbsp;It great, that even though my Mac is out of warranty and my hard drive failed, I'm going to get it fixed for free. It will just take a couple of weeks.<br></p><p>My plan is to go iPad only. &nbsp;I'm actually pretty sure I will be able to get by pretty well. &nbsp;It should be an interesting experiement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>It's Final, Plan Tickets Bought</title>

<p>I've been itching to travel again, as it's been a really long time since I've gone any considerable distances (since I came back from my <a href="/blog?tag=Jaunt%20Down%20South%202010">J</a><a href="/blog?tag=Jaunt%20Down%20South%202010">aunt Down to South America</a>). In two weeks, I'll be heading down to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco">San Francisco</a> for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.macworldiworld.com">Macworld / iWorld event</a>. It's a trade show and conference. This year, I can only really afford to do the expo hall, but hopefully in future years I might be able to attend the actual conference portion. Minnie has been calling it my nerd conference. I guess I have a lot more nerdery that I partake in, then I share here. Minnie's always reminding me about it. When I'm driving, and want to listen to&nbsp;<a href="/blog?tag=Podcasts">my podcasts</a>, she calls them my&nbsp;&nbsp;nerd casts. She makes fun of me because after she goes to bed, I've been watching my nerd show. Netflix is amazing. I've never watched&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.startrek.com/page/star-trek-the-next-generation">Star Trek Next Generation</a>, and I've always been much more of the original <a target="_blank" href="http://starwars.com">Star Wars</a> Fan. I'm enjoying it.</p><p>With all of those great nerd activities, it makes sense for me to be going to a nerd conference. I'm sure that I will be posting more as I go along.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's been a whirl wind of a trip so far. I arrived in San Francisco at about 12:50 at the airport, but it was a real mission getting to my hotel, as I didn't get there until about 3 something in the afternoon. I ended up taking the BART (<a href="http://www.bart.gov">Bay Area Rapid Transit</a>), which was a great ride. I found myself really disconcerted with the app I had downloaded to try to navigate my trip. I ended up using the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/embark-ibart-san-francisco/id288656960?mt=8">Embark iBART</a>. I didn't realize that it was not going to give my any of the other transit directions. It told me to to get off at station at 22nd and Mission and walk two miles and something. I read it, and figured it wouldn't' be too bad. While it's not that far, walking with my Indiana jones style bag and towing my Swiss Gear carry on bag behind. Not only was it an hour and a half walk, but it started me off walking down Mission in one of the poorer areas of San Francisco lining the road with the homeless or vagrants.</p><p><strong>22nd and Mission San Francisco CA</strong></p>&nbsp;<p><font color="#111111"><strong>Tweet with My Bag in It...</strong></font></p>

<p>I checked in at my hotel, <a href="http://aidaplazahotel.com">Aida Plaza Hotel</a>. It is clean, but very antiquated hotel very much near the financial district. It was the cheapest hotel that I could find with short notice last week. The room I paid for has shared bathrooms and showers. The room is pretty small, but is perfect what I need it for.  After getting myself settled in and getting my bearings (and resting my legs a little bit) I made my way to Monscone Center where the conference and expo hall is being hosted. I was able to get over there and get my first glimpse of the exposition hall. More than the trade type show floor, there is a conference with various trainings regarding how to use various software and other creative activities. There is also an IT conference and training all combined into this event. I was only able to purchase the lowest cost ticket (just the expo hall) for financial reasons. This being said, there has been more than enough to keep me busy wandering around the conference.</p><p>The first day, I just walked around and really tried to take in the whole scene. I didn't really stop at many booths or connect with anybody too much. As the hall closed for the first day, I walked to <a href="http://www.melsdrive-in.com/hoursandlocations/missionstreet.html">Mel's Drive-in</a> for Dinner. Back to the Motel and then to <a href="http://www.theboxsf.com">The Box SF</a> for a party and live recording of the <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/cultcast/">Cultcast Podcast</a>. They are a pretty great podcast, and always make me laugh. It's much more news / rumors related then the other shows that I listen to. They had an open bar, which made me feel a bit like a VIP. I got to meet a number of people, but especially a IT consultant from Seattle.</p>

David Sparks is the one being hugged in the middle and Katie Floyd is on the far right. It was cool to get to meet them. [/caption] 
  

<p>The next morning, I made my way back to the Expo Hall. I spent the majority of the day doing a bit of deeper dive into all of the booths, asking questions, and looking at all the cool stuff being sold (I really wish I had some money to buy stuff, there are some great deals). I've been able to meet some of the developers for applications that I love on my Mac. I also got to meet <a href="http://katiefloyd.me">Katie Floyd</a> and <a href="http://macsparky.com">David Sparks</a> of the <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com">Mac Power Users</a>, my absolute favorite podcast. It felt a bit like meeting some rock stars, at least in the geek circles.</p><p>Afterwards I made my way down to <a href="http://www.sanfranciscochinatown.com">China Town</a>. I walked down a ways, and ended up having a Mai Tia at a bar, that the bartender told me is the oldest bar in China Town and having a good conversation with a guy from Brazil and another guy who works as an activist for an environmental organization.</p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

</div><p>All in all, it's been a lot of fun. Today, I'm going to go back to the Expo Hall for a little while. I'm hoping to do a bit more of the tourist thing. I haven't decided yet, but I'm thinking the Worf.

<p>I'm back at home now. The rest of my trip was fun, and went by very quickly. My last day in San Francisco was a little obscured by rain. I went back for one more trip to the expo hall and made my way around all of the smaller iOS and OSX Developers. I signed up to try to win a <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/us/services/computing/peripherals/scanners/scansnap/">ScanSnap Scanner</a> (they are really amazing, and I'm planning on buying one at some point). If I had money, I would have also bought a <a href="http://www.filetransporter.com">File Transporter</a> because there was a great discount and I've been wanting one for a long time. There was a ton of other stuff that was very interesting, and I could see myself using and purchasing in the future. I got to sign up for the public beta for <a href="http://www.busymac.com/busycontacts/index.html">BusyMac new contact management software</a> which will be released soon.</p>

<p>I walked around the Financial District for a while and went to the Apple Store (I've actually never been to a real apple store. It was cool, but I was much more blown away by the Macworld Event. I went to bed early that night, because I had to get up at 3:45 AM to be able to catch my 7 am flight. I arrived at Sea Tac Airport and started making my way back to the Tri-Cities to see my Family. You can see the following video's that I uploaded to YouTube of Mateo playing with the Slow Motion controls on my iPhone 5s. It makes me laugh :). I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>Make sure to check out my album, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.860534081086.1073741838.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=3457377e36">Macworld / iWorld 2014</a>. on Facebook, as I've uploaded the rest of my photos from the trip.</p>

<p>While I am not hyper typographically aware, I do still care quite a bit about it. In my <a href="/design">design</a>, I do feel that that I practice ok typography. There are a great number of articles and stuff written by typography devotees that I will not spend very much time ranting about my likes and dislikes.</p><figure >

    <span>&#147;</span>Be­cause you are a pro­fes­sion­al writer, you are already a ty­pog­ra­ph­er. You may be a re­luc­tant ty­pog­ra­ph­er. You may be an un­skilled ty­pog­ra­ph­er. But every time you put words on a print­ed page, you’ve made ty­pog­ra­phy hap­pen. So you are a typographer.<span>&#148;</span>

  <figcaption class="source">&mdash; Why typography matters, Buttrick's Practical Typography</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I recently finished reading <a href="http://practicaltypography.com">Butterik's Practical Typography</a>. It's an online book, something that I've never seen before. It's an interesting way to publish a book. Due to the topic, I think that it is probably one of the best possible ways to publish. When I am wondering how to do something typographically, I'm very likely to google it, not to pick up some hardcover book and flip through it. I book marked it and read it on my iPad, which I think was much more comfortable to do then on a computer screen.</p>

<p>I didn't realize previously how inclusive typography really is. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography">Wikipedia, Typography</a> includes "the arrangement of type involves the selection of typefaces, point size, line length, leading (line spacing), adjusting the spaces between groups of letters (tracking) and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning)."</p>

"/>  The cover to our pamphlet that i am working with my co-workers to put together. [/caption] 
  

<p>Buttrick goes through all of the different components of typography, along with font selection (which is what I used to think typography was). I found myself realizing how bad some of my typography for my day job really is. I've started adjusting my form letters that I write to my clients. I also went through and adjusted my personal letterhead (yes, I have my own letterhead, because I'm a little bit crazy).</p>

<p>One major project that a couple of co-workers and myself have undertaken is trying to reduce the number of forms our clients have to fill out during their initial mental health evaluation. Because we are a community counseling agency, the amount of forms they have to complete is pretty outrageous. We are attempting to go through and have a simple pamphlet. i obviously said that I would love to actually format and put together the pamphlet wanting to be able to implement some of the skills I had learned.</p>

<p>If you every have to write reports, letters, anything that you give to anybody else, I'd highly recommend reading Buttrick's book!</p>

      <title>Mileage Tracking Form and Launch Center Pro</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/8/mileage-tracking-form-and-launch-center-pro</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/5402970fe4b0a7034afa9e0b/1409455916115/mileage-tracking-lauch-center-pro-ifttt-google-sheets.jpg" alt=""/>
  


<p>On <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2014/4/jump-in-the-stream-favorite-podcasts#.VAKHA0tFEds=">my favorite podcast</a>, <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/">Mac Power Users</a> I feel like I've heard about <a href="http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">Launch Center Pro</a> a number of times. I've thought about purchasing it a number of times, because I really like the concept automation. I've kept putting off purchasing it because I didn't know exactly what I would do with it. I use <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> all of the time on my iPhone and my iPad, and it's always seemed like enough.</p><p>I was reading Dr. Drang's article <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2014/08/late-to-launch/">Late to Launch</a> earlier today, and decided that I did need to buy Launch Center Pro (LCP). I figured that it was ok, because he is late coming to LCP too.</p><p>Basically LCP is an iPhone / iPad app that launches other applications or does tasks within those application. It also gives interaction for IFTTT (which I talked <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2013/1/new-and-fun-functionality#.VAKKKEtFEds">about here</a>), which opens up so many other possibilities.</p><p>In reading Dr. Drang's article, I decided that I needed a simple way to track my mileage. Whenever I go in between schools at my new job, I can submit for a reimbursement for the gas and wear and tear on my car. They don't require a listing of miles driven, but from one building to another building (the school district dictates what the milage is between buildings, for those people who tend to drive circuitous routes). For last month, I went through my calendar and tried to pick out the days that I drove between different buildings. I'm excited about my new system using LCP and think I will save myself time. One of my co-workers told me that she never has time to fill out her form, so maybe I will have to share this with her.</p>
<p>For all of the non nerds out there, this might sound kind of complicated, but really it is not, and it's kind of fun to put together. I'll walk you through what I did. Basically I have an action in LCP that opens two lists which I select from which schools I'm drive from and to, sends those as a row in a google spreadsheet, and then at the end of the month, IFTTT sends me an email with a link to the spreadsheet to remind me to copy and past it onto the correct from.</p>

Two clicks and I'm done... &nbsp;iPhone mockup thanks to&nbsp;  Pixel Den  [/caption] 
  

<p>The first step is to create a new action in LCP. I just went through their action composer, found the IFTTT trigger, had it complete a Trigger Recipe with Values. I named my Recipe "Mileage Tracker" (I had to name it the same thing when creating my recipe on IFTTT). Then I set two values as "input with a list." I made list items of each of the schools that I might go from so that one list is the school building I was leaving and the second would be the school building I would be going to.</p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="781.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fbc/51dcde94e4b09506a9c98fc0/54029b02e4b0bc1fe0fd0767/1409456898849/ifttt-screenshot-launch-center-pro.png" alt=" My  IFTTT recipe , "/>  My  IFTTT recipe , [/caption] 
  

<p>Then the IFTTT magic starts. It sends my answers to an IFTT recipe where it appends a spreadsheet in google docs to add the new data (along with the date) to cells in the the spreadsheet. I made a second IFTT rule sending my work email an notification every month on the last day to complete copy and paste the values from the Google Docs to the appropriate spreadsheet and turn it in to receive my reimbursement.</p>

<p>After I got it all working, I was super excited. It feels amazing to know that I can track my mileage with a couple of clicks on my phone and I won't ever have to worry about it again. I might have to think about making it based on location... but we will see so that I don't even have to click anything on my phone.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I'm a firm believer in preparation and planning. I've been told that I'm hyper organized and spend to much time preparing. While this might be true, I find that preparation improves my life in so many ways and that I end up making much better products (whether it's my individual clinical work with my clients, the classes that I teach, or just fun traveling). I think that this is even more true when it comes to parenting, outings with kids, and other fatherhood related topics. When it has come to my <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/?category=Travel+Blog">travel adventures</a>, I've always been uncharacteristically unplanned.</p><p>On Saturday evening we flew out of <a href="http://www.portseattle.org/Sea-Tac/Pages/default.aspx">Seattle / Tacoma International Airport</a> with well laid plans. We thought that taking a red eye flight would mean that <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/?tag=Mateo+Campbell">Mateo</a> would be sleeping and that the flight would be worry and stress free. It started out looking great. He was running all over the airport, super excited about meeting all of the new people that were everywhere. I talked to one of the workers for <a href="http://www.alaskaair.com">Alaska Airlines</a> and they were able to hook us up with an extra seat (we didn't buy one because he is still young enough to be a lap seat baby). Even once we got on the plane, he was doing excellent. About an hour in to our four hour flight, we had thought that he was going to fall asleep, but then it took a turn for the worse.</p><iframe id="forecast_embed" type="text/html" frameborder="0" height="245" width="100%" src="http://forecast.io/embed/#lat=28.3775&lon=-81.5217&name=Lake Buena Vista Florida"> </iframe><p>Mateo started to get super fussy, uncomfortable, and unhappy. He cried loudly on and off for probably a total of two hours of the flight. Minnie described that it was like a nightmare. It all turned out just fine in the end, but it was hectic when there wasn't much that you could do to make things better.</p>

<p>We made it safely to our hotel, <a href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/florida/hilton-orlando-lake-buena-vista-ORLDWHH/index.html">The Hilton at Lake Buena Vista</a>, which is a really nice hotel. When we arrived, at 6 something in the morning, we found out that they had given away our room because we didn't check in yesterday. I had to wait until somebody from the <a href="http://www.pascodiscoverycoalition.org/">Pasco Discovery Coalition</a> came down and verified their card for us to make up to the room. After a little sleep, everything felt much better. The weather in Florida has been on and off rain and thunder storms. Which I find somewhat annoying and somewhat fun.</p><p>We went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Disney_(Walt_Disney_World">Downtown Disney</a>) and got a bit to eat at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Sandwich_(restaurant">Earl of Sandwich</a>) and made our way back to the hotel to relax some. During the days I've been attending the <a href="http://midyear.cadca.org/">CADCA Mid Year Conference</a> and Minnie and Mateo have been hanging out poolside (which Mateo loves). We've had the opportunity to go to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Kingdom">Magic Kingdom</a> which was a lot of fun. My phone was dead almost as soon as we arrived. In the evenings we've mostly been hanging out with other coaltion members. My conference has been really good. There has been a mixture of some really great sessions (especially one session on working with coalitions in Latino communities), and some that weren't so great.</p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

      <title>Is My Mac Magic?</title>

<p>This last week, I had my last day at <a href="http://www.mytcch.org/">Tri-Cities Community Health Behavioral Health Services</a>, and my have started some of my training for my work at the <a href="http://www.psd1.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1">Pasco School District</a>. I've also still been spending quite a bit of time preparing my class lectures for the <a href="http://www.heritage.edu/CampusLocations/TriCities.aspx">Heritage Courses</a> I will be teaching. All that being said, its still a really busy time right now. I figured I'd share some of my geekary from last night that I put together. One of the benefits of being a geek is that can make my computer do magic tricks sometimes, and save myself a lot of hassle and time (although it also means that sometimes I spend a significant amount of time doing things that don't deserve that much time, but that's neither here or there).</p><p>The reason I am so in love with my mac, is some of the amazing software and things that I can do with it, that just weren't possible on a Windows PC. I just downloaded <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro - KM</a>, a really powerful and amazing piece of software. I'm very excited to see what I can all automate with it on my mac. I've put together a couple of what KM calls macros. The first one I did was in apple mail to make keyboard like shortcuts. I'm not going to write about about it, but I did the same as described <a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/53254/gmail-like-keyboard-shortcuts-in-mail-app-keys-without-modifiers">Stack Exchange</a>.</p><p>I love my Apple TV, and even like the little four button remote that comes with it. I like to use it even when I'm given presentations as my clicker. The only problem is that it always tries to control my mac. We will be sitting on the couch and watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0934814/">Chuck</a>, our current show of choice on Netflix, and you click a button and it turns on iTunes or click another button and the volume on my mac goes up and down. It's a bit of a pain to toggle the IR remote on and off. It's kind of hidden in the system preferences. If you are turning it on and off, it might look something like this <a href="https://v.usetapes.com/AxaSINsYsY">short screencast</a>.
While it doesn't take way to long, it is kind of an annoying process, and KM can come to the rescue. It wasn't too hard to set it up and automate the process. I created a keyboard short cut that goes though the whole process with minimal needs for me to do anything when turning on and off the remote.</p><p>Basically here is what it does:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click ⇧⌘→</li>
<li>Open "Security &amp; Privacy Preferences Pane</li>
<li>Pause for 1.5 seconds (so that it has time to open)</li>
<li>Click the gatekeeper lock to unlock the advanced settings</li>
<li>Pause until "Advanced button is available" (waiting for me to put in my password)</li>
<li>Press "Advanced..." button.</li>
<li>Wait for user to (I have to click the check box and pair the IR remote).</li>
<li>Click the "Ok" button</li>
<li>Re-lock the gatekeeper.</li>
<li>Quite the system's preferences pane.</li>
</ol><p>It makes me feel a little bit like my mac does magic for me, so beautiful. You can see the <a href="https://v.usetapes.com/KVk70MAAFE">short screencast</a>.</p><p>Now, I can just click a couple of keys, and turn on and off my Apple TV Remote when I'm teaching... easy as that.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Our European Adventure with a Start in Paris, The City of Lights</title>

<p>It has been a fly by trip so far. My mom, my aunt Geralyn, my cousin Larissa and her boyfriend Shane, and my aunt Barbara and uncle Allen all have made her way over to Europe. Our first stop has been in Paris, the city of lights. It is a beautiful city, with amazing architecture, different little neighborhoods each with their own feel, wonderful architecture, and so many different people.</p><p>My mom and I left from the Pasco Airport to Seattle Tacoma Airport where we met up with the rest of our family. Then it was a 10.5 hour flight with a nine hour time difference (yes, we are living in the future). We have been walking a ton. I thought that it might be interesting to share how far we actually have been walking. I have been wearing my Apple Watch (which I absolutely love) the whole trip, so I have a pretty good idea of how far we've been walking each day so far.</p><div class="chart-block-container chart-type-1009" data-settings="{&quot;dataTableId&quot;:&quot;57a09cbb15d5dbfa9f22f964&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Miles Walked Each Day&quot;,&quot;legend&quot;:&quot;visible&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;The number of miles I have walked each day so far as a part of the trip.&quot;,&quot;chartType&quot;:1009,&quot;palette&quot;:&quot;Thunderbird&quot;,&quot;flip&quot;:true,&quot;dataTable&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57a09cbb15d5dbfa9f22f964&quot;,&quot;data&quot;:[[4.32],[8.32],[13.14],[13.09]],&quot;seriesLabels&quot;:[&quot;Miles&quot;],&quot;sampleLabels&quot;:[&quot;Friday&quot;,&quot;Saturday&quot;,&quot;Sunday&quot;,&quot;Monday&quot;]}}">

<p>We arrived in Paris after leaving Friday morning at 8:30 am on Saturday morning. It took a couple of hours to wait to go through customs and we found ourselves a taxi to our hotel, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hotel-belle-juliette-paris.com/">Hotel &amp; Spa La Belle Juliette</a>. The hotel is somewhat expensive, and much more expensive then any hotels &nbsp;that I would generally choose, but it is very chic with beautiful small rooms with iMacs in every room that double as a TV. After checking in, we were hungry and headed to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lenemrod.com">Le Nemrod</a>&nbsp;to get some food and then made our way to a giant beautiful park to wander around a little bit. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.senat.fr/visite/jardin/index.html">Jardin du Luxembourg</a> is absolutely a wonderful place to go, and really felt very much the epitome of what I imagine when I think of France. There was wonderful statues, old men playing chess and Bocci Ball, and many people just passing time with each other at a slow pace.</p>

<p>After wondering around the park for a couple of hours, playing some Pokémon Go (yes, you have to catch them all) and finding some pizza for dinner we made our way back to the hotel to relax and sleep after a sleepless two days.</p>

<p>Sunday, was a busy day with so many views of the city and little adventures along the way. We made our way to do some shopping and pick up some produce at the Mouffetard Market. Rue de Mouffetard and the market that is nearby is a little get away from modern life with cobble stones and small little stores all around. After doing a little shopping and resting our feet a little bit, we made our way to the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthéon">Panthéon in Paris</a>.&nbsp;I will be posting a bunch of pictures from our trip on Facebook (and I'm sure I'll share a link on here in the future), but the internet that I've mostly found has been fairly slow and difficult to upload. Just making this post with a couple of pictures has been a challenge.</p>

It was originally built as a church dedicated to St. Genevieve and to house the reliquary châsse containing her relics but, after many changes, now functions as a secular mausoleum containing the remains of distinguished French citizens. It is an early example of neoclassicism, with a façade modeled on the Pantheon in Rome, surmounted by a dome that owes some of its character to Bramante’s ‘Tempietto.’<span>&#148;</span>

<p>I got the opportunity to climb to the top of the Panthéon and take some really great shots of all of Paris. We walked down to the Zig Zag Café where I got the opportunity to try some Escargot for the first time and then we made our way to the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_de_Paris">Cathédrale Notre Dame</a>. Absolutely one of the best cathedrals that I've seen in my various trips. By night, we went to see the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower">Eiffel Tower</a>, and shared a bottle of some tequila as we walked home and so many laughs and fun times with my family.</p><p>Monday was a trip to the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre">Louvre Museum</a>, some Jazz at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sunset-sunside.com/">Sunset Subside</a>&nbsp;and sharing some checha at the Isis Café.&nbsp;Today has been mostly a relaxed day, and giving me an opportunity to share a little bit of our adventure with all of you. Here is looking forward to more stores as we go through France and Europe for the next couple of weeks. I will also be posting some photos to Facebook, so look forward to that.</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

    <span>&#147;</span>A Black Madonna or Black Virgin is a statue or painting of Mary in which she, and oftentimes the infant Yahshua are depicted with dark skin, especially those created in Europe in the medieval period or earlier. The Black Madonnas are generally found in Catholic and Orthodox countries. The term refers to a type of Marian statue or painting of mainly medieval origin (12th to 15th centuries), with dark or black features.<span>&#148;</span>

<p>The city of lights was beautiful. You can find my photo album on Facebook, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10100259365182336.1073741840.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=61670512fa">Paris, City of Lights</a>. After spending four nights in Paris, we caught a train heading to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse">Toulouse</a>, in the Southern France region. In Toulouse, we didn't really spend much time. We rented cars and spent a little bit of time getting some lunch and wandering around the Toulouse downtown for a bit. We tried to go and see the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Madonna">Black Madonna</a>, but we couldn't find parking. We rented two &nbsp;cars, mine was a manual. I hadn't driven a manual transmission car since I was in high school, but after we got into the windy roads of the French Countryside in Midi-Pyrénées, I was glad that was my car. It felt exhilarating to be shifting through all of the roads.</p>

<p>Heading to the Commune of Fabas, we went to the wrong Fabas at first (putting us about 45 minutes in the wrong direction), but we finally made it to some of the most wonderful country I've ever seen. We spent four nights in the area. My mom, Geralyn and I stayed at an old family friend of my mother and I, Sheila and Dennis. They used to live in the Dayton Watisburg area where I grew up. They built a house, in the countryside with the most spectacular view. You can check out photos on Facebook album, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10100262325235366.1073741841.44504407&amp;type=1&amp;l=6d066c7b40">French Countryside in the Midi-Pyrénées</a>. We got the opportunity to do a lot of different things while we were there.</p>

<p>Before heading out on our trip, I was the least excited about visiting the countryside. I was thinking that I wouldn't like it as much, because it is out of the city, but it was amazing! We spent one day touring various small villages, passes, and outlooks. &nbsp;The views from the some of the passes, and Lake Bethmal were breathtaking. We even picked wild huckleberries on the mountain side. I was amazed at the roads, and sites especially knowing that often times the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.letour.com/us/">Tour de France</a> goes through these mountains. It made me tired just thinking about it. In the City of Seix, I ended up ordering horse (common food in France), it was good and tasted mostly like cow.</p><figure >
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>In 1858 Lourdes rose to prominence in France and abroad due to the Marian apparitions seen by the peasant girl Bernadette Soubirous, who was later canonized. Shortly thereafter the city became one of the world’s most important sites of pilgrimage and religious tourism. Today Lourdes hosts around six million visitors every year from all corners of the world. This constant stream of pilgrims and tourists transformed quiet Lourdes into the second most important center of tourism in France, second only to Paris, and the third most important site of international Catholic pilgrimage after Rome and the Holy Land. As of 2011, of French cities only Paris had more hotel capacity.<span>&#148;</span>

<p>Another one of the days, some of us went to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes">Lourdes, France</a>. It was a bit of drive, but is an interesting town. There are hundreds of people with diseases, handicaps, and different abilities that make the pilgrimage to Lourdes to seek healing. The church of Lourdes, is gorgeous and I'm pretty sure it is what Disneyland is modeled after.</p><p>We also had an amazing five course traditional French meal at the bed and breakfast the rest of my family was staying at. The food was amazing, and we sat, ate, talked, ate, drank, ate, and drank more for almost three and half hours. A wonderful experience.</p>

<p>The next morning, we set off early, heading to Nice. When I told family and friends that I was going to France, everybody was worried because of the attack that happened about a month before our trip in Nice. It was unfortunate that we only got to stay one night in Nice, because it was a hip, vibrant, and fun town. We spent 10 hours driving from Sheila and Dennis to Nice, toll bridges, and craziness, but it was absolutely worth it.</p><p>Then it was a train to Florence with a stop in Milan. Our train was late arriving in Milan, and the carrier wouldn't refund our ticket so we had to wait for another one and purchase it again.</p><p>In Florence we've had the opportunity see David, walk the streets, go shopping, I've gone out a couple of nights and gotten to experience some of the nighlifte, and stay in an absolutely beautiful hotel (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.krafthotel.it">Kaft Hotel</a>) with a terrace roof and restaurant and pool. We leave tomorrow to head to the last leg of our trip and Rome.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I am nobody special and the things that I have gone through (in feeling) are not uncommon.  Most everybody has felt the pain of abandonment, the hurts that only somebody close can give, or the loss of somebody close.  This generation coming up, is a fatherless one.  This is partly the cause of so many angry kids and too many young people who live seemingly purposeless lives.  I will tell you the truth though God is big enough to fill the void for all those kids, and the voids in all of our lives.  My name is Jacob Campbell, and I was born October 18, 1982.  Some of my earliest years were spent in a courtroom with my father.  He was on trial for three accounts of murder.  This was going on in Snohomish County, and his name was like a household item, for those living in the area.  Charles Rodman Campbell was and sentenced to death row.  During the same era that &quot;Death Row Records&quot; with Tu Pac, Dr. Dre, and others was created, I was visiting my dad on Death Row at Walla Walla State Penn.  Even though he was in prison we had a good relationship, sometimes, because my mom and I would visit him weekly.  My dad would also write me letters all the time, I wouldn't write him back very often though (I was young).  In 1994, when I was in the 6th grade there was a decision that my fathers time was up.  I went and petitioned the Governor, I didn't want my dad to die.  He was executed, only the second man to be executed in the state of Washington recently.</p>

<p>This caused a lot of hurt in my life, and I started wanting to run away from it all.  In middle school I did not really have any friends.  When I got into High School I got involved heavily in the party scene.  I look back now it seems like I was trying to dull my senses.  I abused almost any drug that you might name, and had my life completely caught up in the whole scene.  The really scary thing was my drinking, I would also go and nightly drink until I was stupid drunk past the point of control and feeling.  I should have died a number of times driving recklessly drunk.  I was in jail, when some people came and told me about this program called Jubilee.  I listened to them, but it didn't seem like the kind of thing that I wanted to do.  I was satisfied with the way my life was.  It wasn't until weeks after I was out of Benton County Corrections, and Jose Hernandez (then the Director at Jubilee) called my at my school, the local alternative high school, and told me about the scholarship that I would receive if I graduated from Jubilee.  I took a huge leap and put myself into the program.  I had decided to go for completely opposite reasons, then those that I would later leave the program with.  I was only going to receive the scholarship, not thinking about changing my life.  Luckily, God had a different plan.  Talking with some of the Residential Councilors and being surrounded by the Word started to tug on my heart.  One day I herd God speaking to me about being my comforter.  I asked Him to come into my heart, and my life, and I haven't been the same since.  The Tri-City Harold wrote an <a href= "http://www.tri-cityherald.com/tch/local/story/8701344p-8602437c.html">article</a> (it is no longer a valid link, I will post a graphic / text of it at a later time) about me, and somebody even wrote an <a href= "http://www.tri-cityherald.com/tch/opinions/letters/story/8733004p-8634702c.html">opinion</a> (it is no longer a valid link, I will post a graphic / text of it at a later time)peice about my life.</p>  <p>I've come a long way's in my life, and have overcome some obstacles, but I am still growing.  That is the desire of my heart that I can identify with Jesus in my life.  I'm learning more about who God has created me to be, and finding out how to follow him.  I went and lived in Spokane for two years, doing this discipleship program call the Master's Commission.  During this time I was able to deal with a lot of the issues in my life.  I have found God to be my forgiver, breaking off the shame that has tried to pull me down so many times.  I've also heard Him call me His son.  It's the greatest revelation that we are children of God.  That he calls us by His name, and we are created in His image.  I have so much further to go, but the foundation has been set, and I've tasted and know that God is Good.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 id="callings">Callings</h2>

<p>I believe that deep down inside of each and every one of us, is a passion for something. One thing that have I have always enjoyed is listening to people talk about whatever they are passionate about. I love it when I get to see someone's eyes light up as they describe what they love to do. I think these things that we are so passionate about are our callings. Finding way's to do things we are passionate about is vital to a fufilled and satisfied life. Like King Soloman described in Ecclesiastes, there is a time for everything. My life has been full of different seasons. This website is to hopefully give you a bit of a picture of what some of those seasons have been. It's also meant to teach you a little bit of some of the stuff I've learned along the way.</p>

<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>

<p>I've been told that, for my age, I have a lot more experiences then many people. I've been educated, having earned my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Social_Work">Masters of Social Work</a> from <a href="http://www.ewu.edu/">Eastern Washington University</a>. I have a strong passion for working with at-risk youth. I was a student and an intern at a program that was called the Master's Commission at <a href="http://www.victoryfaith.org/">Victory Faith Fellowship</a> in Spokane. Then I spent two years I spent two years working at a <a href="http://jyranch.org/">boy's ranch</a> and about six month working at Spokane Juvenile Detention. I worked for two years at the <a href="http://www.yfaconnections.org/">Crisis Residential Center</a> in Spokane. I'm curretly working for <a href="http://www.mytcch.org/">Tri-Cities Community Health</a>'s Behavioral Health Services in Pasco as a Mental Health Case Manager and Therapist. For more information regarding my work / education history check out my <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/professional-connections">professional connections section</a>. While, I believe formal education and work experience are important, I also have personal experience. I can really relate with at-risk youth because <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/testimony">I was one</a>. I grew up without a normal dad, visiting mine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Campbell">in prison</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing that I am passionate about is traveling. I have been exteremly lucky in my life to travel a lot. I have tried to keep people updated about my life, via my website and social media. You can read my blog posts about <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/european-excursion-2008">traveling through Europe in 2008</a>. In 2009 and 2010 I traveled through South America and ended up spending about a year living in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusco">Cusco Peru</a>. You can read about my <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/jaunt-down-south-2010">Juant Down South</a> or see why <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog/2009/07/let-world-change-you-and-you-can-change-world">I decided to travel down there</a>. While I don't always keep <a href="http://jacobrcampbell.com/blog">my blog</a> the most up to date, there are lots of different stories that I have written here.</p>]]></content:encoded>
