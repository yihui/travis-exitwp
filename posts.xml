		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I met Marija Kislicyna, "kommissar" of the Russian youth <br />movement Nashi. She's head of the project "Russia for everybody" <br />("Rossiya dlya vsekh"), and follows programmes meant to improve <br />relations between different ethnic groups living in Russia. The <br />tagline is that it doesn't matter if you are Russian, Tatar or <br />Chechen, as long as you're conscious of being a citizen of Russia. <p /> I got some more information about Nashi's programmes in this field, <br />and I will most probably write more about it at some point. Anyway... <p /> News of the day (for me at least): <p /> Nashi will probably organize a large youth summer camp involving young <br />people from all the regions of the Northern Caucasus. It should take <br />place in the region of Stavropol next summer. Details are yet to be <br />decided, but the idea is to have about 20,000 young people coming in <br />five turns of 4,000 participants each, on the model of the all-Russian <br />Seliger youth camp (<a href="http://seliger2010.ru/)">http://seliger2010.ru/)</a>. It is dedicated to the <br />youth of the Russian Caucasus, and most probably there will be <br />delegations coming from Abkhazia and South Ossetia as well.</p><p>[gallery]</p><p>some leaflets and materials produced by Nashi</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A foggy day in Nazran, Ingushetia</title>
		<link>https://giorgiocomai.eu/2010/02/18/a-foggy-day-in-nazran-ingushetia/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It takes about half an hour by mini-bus to get from Vladikavkaz, North Ossetia, to Nazran, Ingushetia. In spite of these, residents of one city apparently scarcely visit the other. Anyway, this is a long story, and I'm not going into that...<p />  The first thing one notices approaching Ingushetia is the extremely visible presence of military units. Check points at the border between the two republics. Soldiers with automatic gun machines all along the main road, all in camouflage uniforms with heavy bullet-proof vests, some even with their faced covered with balaclavas. It does make you feel a bit uneasy.<p />  The second thing that meets the eye is the huge number of brand new buildings on both sides of the road...apparently, many of them built after the wave of refugees that followed the beginning of the second Chechen war in 1999. <p />  Today, Yunus-bek Evkurov, president of Ingushetia held a meeting with the students of the local university (see picture below). He seems to be a rather straightforward man, underlining the importance of stabilization and security as a precondition for all the rest. He answered the questions of the students, and gave instantly orders to members of his government (present in the hall) to satisfy some of them. The discussion seemed to be really open, and students looked willing to ask rather uncomfortable questions...for example &ldquo;why aren't you defending the honour of the Ingush people for what concerns issues like the deportation of 1944 and <em>prigorodnyj rajon</em>?&rdquo;, or, more practically, &ldquo;Last year you promised to add new buses for students to go back home in the evening. We haven't seen any. Why?&rdquo;.<p />  Well, it might be not as good as it seems, but I have to admit that I generally liked his &ldquo;don't-want-to-tell-you-fairy-tales&rdquo; attitude. Still, I am particularly dubious about his over-reliance on traditional <em>tejp</em> structures to solve the problems of the region... anyway, I will most probably write more about it <a href="http://twitter.com/balkanscaucasus">@balkanscaucasus</a><p />  Later I met the head of the Ingushetia office of well known human right organisation <em>Memorial. </em>It was really an interesting meeting. The office of the organisation is very basic (see the entrance hidden among clothing shops in the picture below), but this proves just once more that this is a real Ngo. I'll publish our discussion as an interview <a href="http://twitter.com/balkanscaucasus">@balkanscaucasus</a>, probably in March. <p />  I got back to Vladikavkaz late in the afternoon...in Nazran, it was snowing lightly, and it was really foggy... (see picture below). Nonetheless... I can imagine it with blossoming trees, gentle hills, and mountains far away, but still well in sight.<p />  It might well take some time for Spring to come to Ingushetia. But I'm sure, it will.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, "The Economist" has published <a href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15636231">a cover story</a> about gendercide, i.e. the practice of selective abortion in order not to have female children. En passant, "The Economist" mentioned that Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are three among the four top countries in the world rankings of countries by sex ratio at birth (male/female). The article mostly focussed on China and India, that are numerically much more important, and didn't explain why this phenomenon is widespread in the South Caucasus. The motivations behind this practice in China, for example, are to be found in economic and social factors, as well as in the "one child policy". Apparently, they hardly apply to the countries of the South Caucasus.<p /> Nonetheless, here are the data provided by the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2018.html?countryCode=am&amp;rankAnchorRow=#am">CIA World Factbook</a>:<strong><p /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sex ratio at birth (male/female)</span></strong><br /> Armenia: 1,14<br />Azerbaijan: 1,13<br />Georgia: 1,13<p />According to these data, the three countries of the South Caucasus are the three countries in the world where this coefficient is highest. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_sex_ratio">check the ranking compiled on Wikipedia</a>)<p /> Considering that the natural sex ratio at birth is closer to 1,05, these data seem to suggest that in the countries of the South Caucasus selective abortion is practiced in order not to have a female child. This would be particularly surprising given the fact that such a practice is not widespread in any country neighbouring the region.<p /> According to<a href="http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/2010/en_GB/wp2010-15/"> a report published by UNDP</a> in March 2010, "The Demographic Transformation of Post-Socialist Countries", by Elizabeth Brainerd, in Soviet times the ratio was close to 1,05 (pag. 8), and the reason why "evidence of son preference has emerged so rapidly is surprising and difficult to explain." Brainerd quotes official statistics by the local governments that do differ from CIA data, but confirm the existence of the problem (sex ratio&nbsp; for children age 0-4, Armenia 1,145, Azerbaijan 1,168, Georgia 1,104). <p /> France Mesl&eacute;, Jacques Vallin and Irina Badurashvili have written an interesting chapter in a book published in 2007 (<a href="http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Publications/pdf/BOOK_singapore.pdf">available for download</a>) dedicated to this issue, titled &ldquo;A sharp increase in sex ratio at birth in the Caucasus. Why? How?".<p /> They basically confirm this negative trend, but do not find compelling explanations of this phenomenon. Nonetheless, the chapter is an extremely interesting reading that depicts clearly the situation. Graphs show how sex ratio at birth increased steeply after the fall of the Soviet Union, and how it did not change in all other countries of the former Ussr (including Central Asia). It show on maps how this phenomenon is widespread in the different regions of the three countries (and not in neighbouring regions of Russia or Turkey), making clear that this is not limited to the cities or to small villages, but is an issue that involves different territories, and that in some regions this figure is higher than 1,20. Besides, the fact that sex ratio at birth is so much higher for the third born child than with the previous (the figure gets closer to 1,40), it seems clear that there is a conscious attempt to refuse to give birth to a female child, in particular if the first two were already female.<p /> The authors mention previous studies (in Georgian) claiming that the problems acutally lies in poor birth registration data, but this seems hardly convincing.<p />The authors of this article naturally claim that "as convincing as these indicators may be, we do not have definitive proof that the increase in sex ratio at birth in the countries of the Caucasus is due to the spread of scans and the practice of sex-selective abortion."<p /> Anywyay, if this hypothesis is confirmed, it would mean that between 10 and 20 percent (and possibly more) of young parents in the southern Caucasus are ready to recur to abortion if they find out that they're expecting a girl instead of a boy. Or that more generally, parents are much more likely to recur to induced abortion if they're expecting a girl, especially if previous children were also girls.<p /> This sounds scary, and I would definitely welcome any other sound theory able to explain the data. Besides, this sounds honestly strange and unexpected... Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, however similar in many aspects, are countries that have different traditions and whose citizens follow even different religious faiths. It is all the more strange, considering the fact that no other country of the region has showed a similar trend.<p /> In Europe, this phenomenon is present also in some parts of the Balkans, most notably in Albania and Kosovo (sex ratio around 1,10)...but still, well below the level recorded in the Caucasus.<p />I am looking forward to find out more about this, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">so if anyone reading this post has more updated data or sound alternative explanations, please let me know</span>... I'm definitely willing to read and write more about it...<br /> I have been looking for more information about this topic for a few months already, but couldn't find anything more. I was actually very surprised to find so little about it online... I think this is a very serious problem, and there should probably be more awareness about it.<p /> Looking forward to hear comments and ideas...</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[International youth camp Seliger 2010, July 1 - July 8, Russia. <p /> Preliminary notes written on a bus from Seliger to Moscow. Pictures will follow in the next few days. <p /> Seliger is the location where in the last couple of years the Russian government, through its Federal agency for youth affairs, has been organizing summer camps for young people from all over Russia. The same location was previously used by the much discussed youth organisation "Nashi". - first international camp run by the Russian government. Thousands of participants from dozens of countries (89 according to what President Medvedev said speaking at Seliger on July 8). <p /> - goal of Seliger in 2010 and previous editions: to bring together young people from all over Russia, offer them a chance to show their ideas and talents, do networking and obtain support for their projects directly from the country's leadership,without filters or limits imposed by their social or geographical position (social lift), support the current leadership of Russia and the current political course, promote healthy lifestyle (lots of sport activities, ban on alcohol drinking), promote family values (with weddings strongly encouraged to take place during the camp). A success? <p /> -goals of the international camp at Seliger (or why a patriotic youth camp was opened to hundreds of people from all over the world): <br /> * to break stereotypes about Russia among foreign guests (declared goal...a failure? Large portraits of Russia's leaders ostensibly on show; camp awakened in the morning by Russian anthem played through loudspeakers all over the place; strict rules that, albeit in practice softened for foreign guests, were often "imposed" by group instructsors as orders under threat of expulsion and without explanation; lots of communication problems; predominance of Russian, in spite of the prior promise that the official language of the camp would be English to any effect; old busses bringing guests to and from the camp; etc); <br /> * to show off the fact that young people from all over the world decided to come to Russia, promote Seliger and similar initiatives among Russia's youth, also by broadcasting news about the event on state tv, promote Russia's current political course (undeclared goal...a success?); <br /> * to give a chance to young people from all of Russia to meet people from all over the world, hear different point of views and push them to think global (?) <p /> - elements to be stressed: <br /> * strict rules and huge portraits of Putin and Medvedev are a reaction to what happened in the 1990s in Russia and are an expression of the current political phase in the country; <br /> * keywords promoted: competitivity, modernisation, innovation, open society (change with the past); <br /> * youth camps, friendship of the peoples, "cult of the leader", but different approach, different rhetoric (some continuity with the past) <br /> * widespread patriotic and pro-Russian rhetoric (but except for the decorations, no explicit "putinist" propaganda in the speeches or in the activities organised); <br /> * seliger is a fun and beautiful place...windsurfing, kayaking,climbing, shooting, disco parties, beach volley, swimming... wonderful nature, on the shore of a lake, extremely long daytime (white nights) <br /> * most participants said this is an incredible experience,and something they haven't seen before, for its size and scope. <p />  <br />Seliger as a symbol of the current political phase. Focus on economic development and innovation. But calls to build an open society are mixed with patriotic slogans and references to Russia's current leaders.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>List of youth forums taking place in Southern Russia/Northern Caucasus in the summer of 2010</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I'm sending this post while listening to the concert that closes the youth forum <em>Mashuk 2010 </em>(in Pjatigorsk, Stavropolskij Kraj)<span style="font-style: normal;"> open to participants from Stavropolskij Kraj, Karachaj-Cherkessia, Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Chechnya, Dagestan as well as (at least in theory) Abkhazia and South Ossetia. 2000 participants planned (but the actual figure is somewhat smaller).</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">This year a number of youth forums and youth camps has taken place in the northern Caucasus. They have been different in size and scope. Putin explicitly called for the organizations of this kind of events in the Northern Caucasus. Most of them <span style="font-style: normal;">were supported by the Russian government, by Mr. Khloponin, head of the Federal District of the Northern Caucasus and/or by Federal Agency for Youth affairs headed by Vasilij Jakemenko. </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-style: normal;">I'm writing down some thoughts about this forum, but in the meantime, I'd like to share this...</span></p>

<h2>List of youth forums taking place in Southern Russia/Northern Caucasus in the summer of 2010</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">In May, the final stage of the “<strong>Student's Spring</strong>” has taken place in Nal'chik, capital of Kabardino Balkaria, a festival that involves “creative students” (singers, dancers, actors, etc.) from about 70 Russian regions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">On July 18-23, Nal'chik hosted the youth forum “<strong>Kavkaz 2020</strong>”, a forum planned for one thousands participants coming from all of the Russian federation (but where North Caucasus republics were disproportionally highly represented) organized by Russia's dominant party <em>Edinaja Rossija </em>and its youth branch <em>Molodaja Gvardija </em><span style="font-style: normal;">and largely sponsored by the regional and federal budget. </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">On July 23-31, the Russian Congress of Caucasian Peoples organized a youth forum called “<strong>It's better together</strong>” in Dombaj, Karachaj-Cherkessia. Its participants were 200 “young leaders” from the region.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">In July, <strong>Irex Russia</strong> (supported by USAID), organized two forums for young leaders in Kabardino Balkaria...in total, about two hundreds participants between 14 and 24 years old coming from all the territories of the Northern Caucasus.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">On August 22-28, youth forum “<strong>Volga 2010</strong>” has been organized in the Volgograd region in collaboration with <em>Edinaja Rossija</em>. It is planned for about 1500 participants... <a href="http://smd34.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=195:-l-2010r&amp;catid=39:2010-03-15-07-03-33&amp;Itemid=1" target="_blank">apparently</a>, and funnily enough, participants come from 40 Russian regions, as well as from “Abkhazia, Czech Republic, Italy and Japan”.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">For September, another youth forum has been organized in the Astrakhan region (<strong>Selias 2010</strong>), dedicated to young people from the Caspian region, including people from southern Russia/northern Caucasus as well as international guests from Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Azerbaijan.</p>

<h3>Mashuk 2010</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">But probably the biggest of them all, and the one more openly supported by the Russian Federal structures, is the youth forum “Mashuk 2010”... planned for 2000 people, it is now drawing to its end in Pjatigorsk, in the territory of Stavropol' (the forum started on August 8 and will close on August 26).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">This list might be incomplete.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">More thoughts, notes and pictures about Mashuk 2010 coming soon...</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>North Caucasus Youth Forum Mashuk 2010, some random notes</title>
		<link>https://giorgiocomai.eu/2010/08/26/north-caucasus-youth-forum-mashuk-2010-some-r/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="Mashuk by giocomai, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/giocomai/8687506483/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7055/8687506483_82848c17ef.jpg" alt="Mashuk" width="500" height="500" /></a>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">The basic idea of the forum is rather interesting... all participants come from the Federal District of the Northern Caucasus (Stavropolskij Kraj, Karachaj-Cherkessia, Kabardino-Balkaria, North Ossetia, Ingushetia, Chechnya, Dagestan) plus, at least in the original project, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">The programme includes training and classes dedicated to “intercultural interaction” that all participants must attend. Basically, participants from different parts of the Russian Caucasus are given a chance to know each other better, to discuss about the stereotypes they have about each other, and so forth.<!--more--></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">Participants are strongly encouraged to develop an own “project” (in the social sphere, or simply a business project). There's a team of experts that help participants in developing the project through different stages. The projects are then judged by this commission of experts, and the winners obtain a state grant to develop their projects (grants are supposed to be between 1250 and 5000 euro). The total amount of the grants is 10 million roubles (about 250,000 euro)... all in all, a rather modest sum... that Prime Minister Putin has declared will be increased to 100 million roubles for the next forum in 2011.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">The “rules of the game” to obtain grants are clear, and comparing to <a href="http://giocomai.posterous.com/seligers-many-faces-my-reportage-from-the-int" target="_blank">Seliger</a> (a larger youth forum dedicated to young people from all of Russia) it seems easier to get support here at Mashuk to improve one's project. It seems to be that in relative terms, here there were more people than in Seliger with a real project they wished to implement (out of 650 participants, about 250 projects were presented, 30 won a grant).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">Some random notes about the things I've noticed in these days... (a more reasoned article to come maybe next week)</p>

<ul>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">all participants live in tents and eat together at an open air canteen;</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">positive and friendly atmosphere;</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">very strict security around the camp... you need to pass two check points to get to the camp;</p>
</li>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">the camp is organized in a place where a Soviet youth camp was based, and some of its half destroyed structures are still very well visible;</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">every day a different region/republic presented its culture and traditions;</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">no delegations from Abkhazia and South Ossetia are actually present (South Ossetia was here in the first shift, apparently only two guys came in the second, while a couple of participants from Abkhazia came in the first days of the camp, then they left, and nobody came...I'll try to make a couple of phone calls to Sukhumi to figure out what really happened in the next few days, since everybody here gave only vague answers)</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">the actual number of participants is smaller than expected... during the second shift that was supposed to have 1000 participants, only 650 were constantly present (this figure excludes occasional guests);</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">evident government support... heads of all the regions involved came to visit the Forum (with the exception of Chechnya's Kadyrov, apparently on holidays);</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">head of the federal agency for youth affairs Vasilij Jakemenko visited the camp on the opening day;</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">head of the federal department for youth affairs Boris Gusev visited the camp on the closing day;</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">large portraits of President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin around the main stage of the camp;</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">head of the federal district of the Northern Caucasus Aleksandr Khloponin visited the camp on August 16;</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">Chechnya's delegation celebrated the birthday of Akhmet Kadyrov, former president of Chechnya, and father of current president Ramzan Kadyrov... the sport competitions of the day were dedicated to Akhmet Kadyrov... portraits of both Kadyrov father and son are on display;</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">one afternoon, the presentation of a “patriotic club” run by <i>Edinaja Rossija</i>, has taken place;</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">participants from different delegations (including Ingushetia and Daghestan) find the food here so bad, that they buy foodstuff separately;</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">loads of organizational problems, especially during the first days of the camp (for example, sleeping bags were missing);</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">projects were presented, and experts were available to help participants developing their social or business project;</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">all projects were then judged by five different experts that judged different aspects of the project (considering probability of success, ability of presenting the project, the partners involved, etc.). the hearings were public, and every expert gave a note between 1 and 10 to every single aspect of the project. The whole process seemed to me rather open. In spite of this, some participants suggested that the selection process was at least partially piloted, and that some applicants were “more equal than others”;</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">management and instructors come largely from central Russia... partially as a consequence, participants from the Caucasus lamented lack of understanding of the local reality from the side of the organisation;</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">in spite of all the rhetoric of integration of participants from different regions, they actually live and work in groups made according to the region they come from, and do have a chance to actually meet each other mostly in the free time or during sport and leisure activities;</p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">lots of changes planned for next year (including a a tenfold increase in the budget for grants and more mixing of participants from different regions during the forum).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal;">You can see some pictures I took during the camp <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/giocomai/sets/72157624807786026/detail/" target="_blank">on my Flickr page</a>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[- Coming from Zugdidi, no passport control whatsoever from the Georgian side. Just a man standing near a post. On the way back, I was asked my passport, job title, and, funnily, phone number.

- In Gali, roads are in terrible conditions, plenty of potholes, asphalt rarely to be seen. Just out of town, as soon as the Gali districts ends, a good recently asphalted road starts... done just a few months ago.

<!--more-->- There are just a very few busses from Gali to Sukhumi, some marshrutkas...nothing compared to the constantly running marshrutkas shuttling between Sukhumi and Psou. Feels detached from the rest of the region.

- Construction boom nowhere to be seen in Sukhumi. A few bars and restaurants opened on the promenade, but that's it, no major reconstruction (or demolition) in sight.

- Somebody's been talking about the fact that Ankvab has started fighting corruption, removing some people from high post. Somebody made me think about the fact that if you want to fight corruption, you do declare that you're firing him/her for taking bribes and you bring him to court. No one taken to court -&gt; no fight on corruption -&gt; he's probably just putting his own people to high posts, or removing people he actively disliked.

- Expect census results for early 2012

- Increasing efforts to strenghten Abkhaz lanugage. But still, not enough teachers. And Sukhumi is predominantly a Russian speaking city.

- While I was in Sukhumi a total blackout lasting for a couple of hours took place, probably in connection with heavy rains in the previous days.

- Plenty of new, expensive looking SUVs, jeeps and similar...makes one wonder...

- Possibly related, I've seen lots of car accidents.

- Many local NGOs benefit of EU funding through Coberm. EUMM stays on the other side of the boundary line, but EU still somehow there.

- Situation in general pretty relaxed... development and state building go slow, but everybody feels safe they'll both continue.

- Top two worries in Sukhumi, possibly related. 1. Abkhaz language and culture in danger
2. Fear to "become like Sochi"

Random pictures attached to random notes...  Cows come back from Inguri, the bridge on the Inguri, domino players in Sukhumi, Sukhumi promenade.

I'll put online many more pictures soon. Interviews and articles to be published in the next few weeks <a href="http://www.twitter.com/BalkansCaucasus">@balkanscaucasus</a> (<a href="http://www.balkanscaucasus.org">www.balkanscaucasus.org</a>)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>ICG's latest report on Abkhazia is timely and its recommendations show the way forward. As usual, it provides a wealth of information and details. Yet, it is not without imprecisions</em>

<!--more--><em>Originally published on <a href="http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Abkhazia/ICG-s-report-on-Abkhazia-some-notes-on-the-footnotes-134284" target="_blank">Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso</a></em>

In the latest report on Abkhazia by the International Crisis Group - <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/%7E/media/Files/europe/caucasus/georgia/224-abkhazia-the-long-road-to-reconciliation.pdf" target="_blank">Abkhazia: The Long Road to Reconciliation</a> - I found a lot of interesting details on how the situation is evolving in Abkhazia. I warmly reccomend to read it in full to anybody wishing to have a better grasp of the dynamics taking place in this territory. Wealth in details is one of the things I really like about ICG publications. For example, in this report they mention the fact that since September 2012, Russian guards joined Abkhazian guards at the de facto border with Georgia: “Now in booths with darkened windows, Russian guards seated behind computer screens check passports and question visitors. During a recent entry by Crisis Group, one Russian and one Abkhaz official manned the booth, with the Russian clearly in charge – though the Russians at the border wear uniforms identical to the Abkhaz, without visible Russian insignia.” (page 5-6)

This is a significant change. When I crossed the de facto border in late 2011, there were no booths. Border guards had to check by phone to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Sukhumi to make sure everything was right with my visa. Since it was early in the morning, I had to wait a couple of hours before anybody picked up the phone at the Ministry. I took the chance to <a href="http://youtu.be/ObsBMdMS7dY" target="_self">shoot some video footage on the Inguri bridge</a>, which shows how indeed it is “a lone, narrow and very dilapidated bridge”, as accurately described at page 23 of the ICG report. When I finally was allowed to enter Abkhazia, border guards took note on a paper notebook. A Russian military camp was located very close to the checkpoint, but Russian military seemed to be uninvolved in the border crossing process.

The interesting details provided in the report make clear that the checkpoint on the Inguri is becoming more formal and institutionalized, and that the Russians are taking charge. I find also that minor details, like the fact that border guards do not have "visible Russian insignia", contribute to offer a more precise and vivid picture of the situation on the ground.

Yet, exactly because details are so important, I would like to point at a few imprecisions included in the report.

<a id="eztoc822774_0_1" name="eztoc822774_0_1"></a>
<h3><b>Some notes on the footnotes</b></h3>
According to the report (page 5), “Russian officers and their families are eligible for Abkhaz citizenship upon completion of service there, as well as the right to retain their state-provided apartments. They are the only group allowed dual citizenship under Abkhaz laws.” It is not exactly so. Abkhazia’s <a href="http://www.emb-abkhazia.ru/konsulskie_voprosy/zakon_j/" target="_self">citizenship law</a> allow all of its citizens to have dual citizenship with Russia. Besides, it allows all ethnic Abkhaz to keep their previous citizenship when they acquire an Abkhazian passport, a provision dedicated in particular to the considerable Abkhaz diaspora in Turkey: should they return, they would be allowed to keep their Turkish passport, wich is of fundamental importance to allow them to travel abroad. The current law, in practice, creates complications in particular for Abkhazia’s Georgians willing to have a Georgian passport.

Note 106 (page 19), refers to the sentence “In a tacit admission that armed groups in the Gali district previously operated with government support, Georgia’s new administration vowed to crack down on them and end any official ties.” The note includes reference to an interview with an official in Sukhumi and links to an unrelated article on Civil.ge (actually, an article related to the contents of note 105). Since a tacit admission of the Georgian government can hardly come from an interview held in Sukhumi, something is probably missing.

Note 117 (page 20), reads “The 31 schools in Gali officially offer instruction only in Russian or Abkhaz. Georgian is taught as a separate course, though many teachers continue to teach in it when they feel they are not under official supervision.” A 2011 report by Human Rights Watch, however, found that 11 schools in Lower Gali had education in Georgian. (“<a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/georgia0711LR.pdf" target="_blank">Living in limbo - The Rights of Ethnic Georgian Returnees to the Gali District of Abkhazia</a>”, Human Rights Watch, 2011, page 3).

Even <a href="http://apsnypress.info/news/4134.html" target="_blank">reports from Abkhazian state-owned news agency</a> claim that of the 169 schools in Abkhazia, 62 of them are Abkhaz language schools, 16 Russian-Abkhaz, 48 Russian, 32 Armenian and 11 Georgian (all of them in the Gali district).

Finally, then minister of education in Sukhumi Indira Vardania personally told me in October 2011 that there are schools in the Gali district with Georgian as the official language of education. She added that along Russian language books, pupils were still using old books passed over from the Georgian side a few years ago (I refer to this in <a href="http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Topics/Human-rights/In-Abkhazia-worried-about-the-language-law-125877" target="_self">my feature story about the language law in Abkhazia</a>, more details in a forthcoming book chapter by this author).

The ICG is absolutely right in recommending that “The Abkhaz authorities should lift legal and practical obstacles to Georgian language education in the ethnic Georgian Gali region”, since indeed there are many obstacles to Georgian language education in Gali. Yet, note 117 claiming that “31 schools in Gali officially offer instruction only in Russian or Abkhaz” does not seem to be correct.

Besides, Abkhazian law does not limit the language of education to only Russian and Abkhaz as suggested in the report (“locals say the Abkhaz authorities have increasingly been enforcing laws on instruction in Russian or Abkhaz”, page 20), but rather says that everybody has right to education in his/her own mother tongue “within the possibilities offered by the education system” (law “<a href="http://www.abiblioteka.info/rus/doc/section_6/abk_law/lang.html" target="_self">On the state language</a>”, art. 7). The same provisions that allows for Armenian language education, would perfectly allow also for Georgian language education.

Finally, the latest ICG report changed a practice used in previous reports to distinguish between “Abkhaz” and “Abkhazian”. The first footnote of ICG’s “<a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/%7E/media/Files/europe/202_abkhazia___deepening_dependence.ashx" target="_self">Abkhazia: deepening dependence</a>” (February 2010), reads “The term Abkhazian(s) refers to residents of Abkhazia, regardless of ethnicity, or to the de facto authorities or institutions. The term Abkhaz (singular as well as plural) refers to a person of Abkhaz ethnicity. The two terms are not used inter-changeably. This report follows that standard usage.” The new report published in April 2013 drops “Abkhazian” and uses only “Abkhaz”, as emerges also from excerpts quoted above “Russian officers and their families are eligible for Abkhaz citizenship” (instead of Abkhazian). The distinction between ethnic Abkhaz and Abkhazian is particularly useful in a territory like Abkhazia that is deeply multi-ethnic and it is a pity that ICG does no longer mark the difference.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some time ago I found at home an old book I bought in a second-hand bookshop in Cracow at the time when I was student in Poland. I ignored it for all these years, but I finally made up my mind and decided to read it.

<!--more--><a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Wiadomosci-z-tamtego-swiata.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Wiadomosci-z-tamtego-swiata-221x300.jpg" alt="Wiadomosci-z-tamtego-swiata" width="221" height="300" /></a>The book was published in Warsaw in 1973 at the time when Gierek was ruling in Poland and Brezhnev in the Soviet Union. I got caught by its curiously-designed cover and its peculiar title, “News from that world”. What could “that world” be, “that other world”, as was immediately made clear in the introduction, for the Polish readers of those years?

That world was the United States of America. The whole book was based on a journey of Krzysztof Teodor Topelitz, a Polish journalist that for six weeks, between April and June 1971, traveled through the United States together with a group of journalists from Europe.

The book is not marred by propaganda, a common feature of many publications of the time, but rather focused on the descriptions of the places the author visited and the people he met. The author doesn't shy away from sharing his own thoughts and considerations on multiple occasions. The book seems to be occasionally naïve (for example when it tells whole episodes of American history quoting at length the words of a tourist bus driver), but as a whole it makes for a pleasant and ultimately quite informative reading.

The feature of this book that pushed me to write about it in <em>Osservatorio</em>'s blog is not related to the description of “that other world”, but rather to what the author refers to when he writes about his own world.

It turns out his world is “Europe”. In the middle of the Cold War, for the author, America is what is really different, as opposed to his own world: Europe, the old continent. He tells about life in America and how everything there is different... it's not the way it is over here, in Europe. Europe, in his writing, doesn't seem to have any internal divisions; Warsaw and Paris, Amsterdam and Odessa can thus be used as common terms of comparison in contrast with a world that is distinctively different, America.

Forty years later, and more than 20 years after the fall of the Berlin wall, it is still common to think about a divided Europe... there is “our Europe” (needless to say, so-called Western Europe) and “that other Europe”. That same Europe that joined the European Union for unexplainable reasons, post-Socialist Europe, the Balkans. In a way, even today what Krzystof Toeplitz was writing sounds somewhat incredible. Hardly anybody today would write: “over there it's a totally different world, not like it is over here in Amsterdam or Belgrade, Paris or Bucharest.”

On the contrary, in 1971 our Polish journalist was talking of a united Europe with fellow European journalists... some of them were talking about the divisions between the Walloons and the Flemish, someone else about Scottish separatism, or referring to a “Europe of Fatherlands”, like de Gaulle used to imagine it. And then Erich, a journalist from West Germany: “Already today Europe is being governed by the great corporations, the Common Market, the Coal and Steel Community […] this is the meaning of European integration.”

Right, the Coal and Steel Community... nobody remembers it now. Indeed, quite a lot of time has passed. Yet, those conversations sound amazingly contemporary.

		<title> In Abkhazia, worried about the language law </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The law "On the state language", approved by the authorities in Sukhumi in 2007, risks exacerbating inter-ethnic relations in Abkhazia, a territory that remains largely multi-ethnic, even after the ethnic cleansing that happened during the war. Our correspondent went to Abkhazia to find out more about it. A feature story</em>

<!--more-->“Do not try to gather too much information in order to demonstrate that non-Abkhaz are treated badly in Abkhazia.”, Indira Vardania told me last year. At the time, she was Sukhumi's minister of Education. She is now deputy prime minister and one of the few women with a prominent role in Abkhazia's politics. “And concerning the language law that you're so worried about, for what concerns the part stating that everybody has the right to study in his or her own language, you can be assured that it is fully implemented.”

Vardania was suspicious that I was there to discredit Abkhazia, as she felt many international observers visiting the region were intent on doing. Obviously, this was not the aim of my visit. But she was right in stating that I was worried about the law “On the state language of Abkhazia.” After a long debate, it was approved by authorities in Sukhumi in 2007. The law states that Abkhaz is the only state language in Abkhazia, that “all citizens of the Republic of Abkhazia must command the state language” (i.e. Abkhaz), and makes clear that members of parliament and heads of local administrations must know and use it.

Given the negligible number of non-ethnic Abkhaz who speak the language, if literally understood and thoroughly implemented, the law would totally exclude non-Abkhaz from political life, be a cause of discrimination, and increase inter-ethnic tensions. The issue is not purely theoretical: even after the war in 1992-1993 that forced more than 200,000 Georgians (out of a total population of about 550,000) to leave the territories now controlled by authorities in Sukhumi (and contested by Tbilisi), contemporary Abkhazia still has a largely multi-ethnic population. Local demographics are highly disputed, but by most accounts, Armenians, Georgians and Russians taken together make up more than 50% of the local population, while ethnic Abkhaz are a plurality, but not a majority, in the territory.

As of today, with the exception of the Gali district inhabited by Georgian returnees, inter-ethnic relations in Abkhazia are broadly non-confrontational, in part due to the fact that Russian is by and large used for daily business by Abkhaz and non-Abkhaz residents alike. Most observers agree on the fact that the language law is not being applied in full, nor will it be after all of its provisions enter into force by 2015. <!--more-->
<h2>In practice</h2>
“The language law cannot possibly be implemented in the near future”, Dalila Pilia, head of “World Without Violence”, a local NGO, told me in the organization's offices in Sukhumi. “Nobody has the right today to demand that everybody in Abkhazia know the language,” she said. “Adequate conditions for its implementation should be offered first.”

In theory, the law provides for dedicated programmes and adequate state support for the implementation of all its parts. For example, a provision dedicated to printed and broadcast media states that at least half of the printed text area of all magazines and newspapers printed in Abkhazia must be in the Abkhaz language, and that the state will support those who publish in Abkhaz.

This, however, seems to be more theory than practice, or at least this was the case when I met Izida Chania, director of Sukhumi-based, Russian and Abkhaz-language independent newspaper <i>Nuzhnaya Gazeta,</i> last year.<i> </i>“In principle, I am in favour of the law as it relates to the media”, she told me as phones kept ringing in the newspapers' small office. The office is not far from the huge, half burned 12-storey building that housed the local government during Soviet times. “And if the authorities did support publishing in Abkhaz, we'd be glad to comply. But for the time being, we comply with the law only in part because, by ourselves, we don't have enough resources.”

Izida Chania argues this is the problem with how the law was approved and implemented as a whole. The final goal of supporting the Abkhaz language is clear, she argues, but little is being done to support it in practice and the timeframe is unrealistic. “If the Abkhaz language were thoroughly taught from kindergartens to university and dedicated language programmes were properly implemented, it would be possible to implement the law in twenty years,” she told me.
<h2>Kindergartens and schools</h2>
The Abkhaz language must now be taught in all schools of this territory on the shore of the Black Sea whose <i>de facto</i> independence has received little international recognition except that of Russia (in August 2008.) But a number of issues make education a complex affair in the territory.

Only about 30 of the 300 kindergartens that existed before the war in the early 1990s are now active. Many schools were destroyed, others were badly damaged. Repairing and reconstructing has been taking place in the last few years, but much is yet to be done. Low salaries for teachers are among reasons cited for the lack of qualified teachers in the republic, a problem further complicated by the needs of multilingual education. Out of the 169 schools currently active in Abkhazia, 62 of them are Abkhaz language schools, 16 mixed Russian-Abkhaz, 48 Russian, 32 Armenian and 11 Georgian (all of them in the Gali district) .

In recent years, authorities have taken measures to support the teaching of the Abkhaz language, but obstacles remain. There are few teachers or textbooks that could be used to teach Abkhaz as a foreign language. There was Abkhaz language education also in Soviet times, but after fourth grade all subjects were taught in Russian.

“It is fair to say there have been problems in the past with the teaching of Abkhaz in Russian and Armenian schools because of the lack of textbooks and educational materials, but this has not been a problem for at least five years”, Indira Vardania told me confidently in October 2011. To prove her point - and her ministry's commitment to the support of the Abkhaz language - she showed me colourful textbooks and other didactic materials for the teaching of the Abkhaz language. “In order to have regular Abkhaz classes also in the [mostly Georgian inhabited] Gali district, we increased the salary of Abkhaz language teachers willing to go there by about 50%”, she added.
<h2>Shools in Gali</h2>
As the topic shifted to the schools in Gali, the tone of the conversation became more tense. Vardania warned me not to trust reports like one published by Kurt Vollebaek, OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities. According to the report, Georgians living in Abkhazia are under pressure from Sukhumi's authorities, their right to education is threatened, and Georgian language schools are being closed. “For what concerns the part of the language law that grants education in one's mother tongue we have no problems, the law is already being implemented in full,” Vardania, head of education in Abkhazia, said confidently.

But a report published by <i>Human Rights Watch</i> in July 2011 ("<a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2011/07/15/living-limbo-0%29" target="_self">Living in Limbo</a> "), which focuses on the situation in the Gali district, explains at length how “in practice, access to Georgian-language education for ethnic Georgians living in the Gali district is restricted,” pointing out how Georgian language schools have been phased out. According to the report, Russian language instruction makes things difficult for children who at home speak mostly Mingrelian (a language belonging to the same linguistic family as literary Georgian) or Georgian, and teachers, who might not have a sufficient command of the language.
<h2>Gali</h2>
<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bagapsh-gali-2011-10-04-13_42_52-00001.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-74677675" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bagapsh-gali-2011-10-04-13_42_52-00001-300x200.jpg" alt="bagapsh-gali-2011-10-04-13_42_52-00001" width="300" height="200" /></a>I wanted to go by bus to Gali, but busses from Sukhumi towards the Georgian-inhabited district are infrequent. I took a car with a few other men I met at the bus station. One is an Ossetian who used to work in the Tkvarcheli mines in Soviet times and came to Abkhazia for a few days to visit a sick relative. The driver is an Abkhazian from Sukhumi. On the road, he picks up his wife, who, knowing we're headed to Gali, decides to take the chance and meet an old friend there. During the journey, the two men start speaking half jokingly in Georgian. Both know the language well. The driver's wife whispers to me “My husband's mother was Georgian. Sometimes he misses speaking the language.”

Gali is still in dire straits. Many houses are abandoned. Cows graze in the park next to the local administration's offices. Roads are in extremely poor condition. A fresh poster of Sergey Bagapsh, the former president of Abkhazia who died a few months earlier, makes clear that the place is under the control of Sukhumi.

When I asked her about the situation with schooling, Nino, a young activist in a local NGO, confirmed that the lack of Georgian-language education is definitely a big problem. The situation is further complicated by the fact that many local residents are forced to choose on which side of the <i>de facto</i> border to stay. For example, if one goes to study in Zugdidi or Tbilisi, her diploma won't be recognized in Abkhazia. Only a few local Georgians are willing to attend university in Sukhumi, thus receiving a diploma that might be of little elsewhere.

In spite of all the problems of local Georgians, Nino is not against the efforts of Sukhumi's authorities to promote Abkhaz. “As we live here, I'm in favour of the fact that pupils in the schools of Gali study Abkhaz. We live together, we should know the language. It certainly won't do any harm,” she told me over a cup of tea.

When, <a href="http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Abkhazia/Abkhazia-s-Armenians-multilingualism-is-the-future-106982" target="_self">a few days earlier, I met Suren Kerselyan</a>, a representative of the Armenian community in Sukhumi, I got a similar response. “We want our children to study Abkhaz and in Armenian schools they do, but not enough.”
<h2>Abkhaz, a language under threat</h2>
In fact, while the “Law on the state language” strongly discriminates in favour of Abkhaz, everybody agrees that Abkhaz, as a language spoken by a tiny group, is under threat by the overwhelming predominance of Russian in all spheres, from business to culture, from pop music to cinema.

Kurt Vollebaek, that same OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities that criticized authorities in Sukhumi for their approach to the Georgian community, <a href="http://www.osce.org/hcnm/78915" target="_blank">stated</a> that “as the Abkhaz language also seems to be under threat, I have offered to support the de facto authorities in Sukhumi in efforts to maintain and further strengthen the knowledge and development of the Abkhaz language.”

Vollebaek has a point. If one looks back at the roots of the conflict, it is clear that fear of losing cultural and linguistic rights - and ultimately disappearing as an ethnic group - was among the driving factors that exacerbated conflict in the early 1990s. Nowadays, the Abkhaz fear of being physically under threat as a group has largely vanished thanks to economic and especially military support from Moscow. On the contrary, fear of cultural assimilation by Russia is possibly stronger than ever. This is probably what led Sukhumi's authorities to approve the highly discriminatory law “On state language” in the first place.
<h2>Crossing the bridge</h2>
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ObsBMdMS7dY?feature=player_embedded" width="540" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>As I cross the bridge on the Inguri that marks Abkhazia's <i>de facto </i>border with Georgia, I am still worried about that law. I understand that common sense will probably prevail in the end, and that the law will be applied only in part or selectively ignored. For example, I don't really expect that, at the next parliamentary elections, all non-Abkhaz will be really banned from running for office. <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01419870.2012.675079" target="_blank">Some analysts</a> already tend to point out the elements of "ethnic democracy" that characterize the Abkhazian political system, even without taking into consideration the structural exclusion of Georgians that had to leave the territory during the war and the ones that returned but did not obtain an Abkhazian passport. Enacting the language law in full without exacerbating inter-ethnic relations, if at all possible, would seriously put into questions the democratic developments that have taken place in the region since it gained <i>de facto</i> independence.

Still, language issues do not end on this side of the Inguri.

In Abkhazia, Russian is the common language and knowledge of Georgian among non-Georgians is completely disappearing. Just across the Inguri, in the uncontested Georgian territories, it is primarily English that is taught in schools as a foreign language (not Russian) and Russian language instruction is becoming rare. As I leave Abkhazia and cross into Georgia, I cannot help but thinking that people living on both sides of the Inguri might soon find themselves without a language in common.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Despite the declarations of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, the after-school service in Romania still lacks adequate support from the State.</em>

<!--more Continue reading... -->

Last spring, Romanian <a href="http://adevarul.ro/educatie/scoala/premierul-victor-ponta-anuntat-renunta-programul-cornul-laptele-muta-banii-programe-after-school-1_5148919300f5182b852a9304/index.html" target="_blank">Prime Minister </a><a href="http://romaeducationfund.ro/en/projects/school-after-school/" target="_blank">Victor Ponta declared</a> he was willing to end the “<i>cornul şi laptele</i>” (“roll and milk”) program to channel any resources that would be saved into more useful initiatives, such as after-school. The statement caused an uproar in the media but, as shown with the beginning of the new school year, there has been no actual consequence.
<h3><b>Roll and milk</b></h3>
The “roll and milk” program, inaugurated in 2002, provides all students in the country's kindergartens and schools with a free roll and a glass of milk. The idea was that of combating drop out rates and contributing to the children's diet, especially of those coming from poor families. “Roll and milk”, though, is a universal program: it reaches all children in the country, irrespective of their income and the place the live in.

The anecdotal evidence first and then a <a href="http://www.publicinfo.gov.ro/library/lapte_si_corn_expert.pdf" target="_blank">survey commissioned by the government</a> have highlighted how most of the snacks offered by the state are simply thrown away. The monotony of milk and rolls - the same every single day - and the poor quality of the products provided by the sub-contracted companies are among the reasons quoted by the report to underline the size of the waste.

Despite the wastes, it is politically difficult to cancel a program that offers food and milk to children; that is also because the initiative has inevitably gone to support the agricultural and food sector, and that of milk production in particular. Indeed, the first protest against the possibility of interrupting the program was raised by the Agricultural Minister, Daniel Constantin who, however, conceded that the program might be rethought and provided only to those who truly needed it.<a id="eztoc874405_0_2" name="eztoc874405_0_2"></a><a id="eztoc871522_0_2" name="eztoc871522_0_2"></a><b>After-school</b>

Last September 16<sup>th</sup> students went back to school and found rolls and milk for everyone. The debate started by the PM in March in order to find important alternative measures has died off, and not even the beginning of the new school year was able to float the media's attention back to the issue.

It is a shame, as experts say the measure proposed last spring by Ponta – an after-school service – could bring highly important benefits to the children and their families as well. Indeed, the after-school program is now only offered as a payment service in private schools or, in some cases, as a project financed by NGOs. The<a href="http://www.worldvision.ro/" target="_blank"> </a><a id="__mce_tmp" href="http://romaeducationfund.ro/en/projects/school-after-school/" target="_blank">Roma Education Fund</a>, for instance, has organized an after-school service especially for Roma communities. <a id="__mce_tmp" href="http://www.worldvision.ro/" target="_blank">World Vision România</a> has supported the implementation of an after-school program in various public schools, located both in cities or in rural areas, to verify its usefulness and understand the problems to consider when making the program even more far-reaching.

The program endorsed by World Vision provides for a free hot meal and educators who in the afternoon can help the children with their homework, their daily lessons, help them rest, play or socialize. The projects realized provide for a psychologist to be involved and contribute to improve the interaction between schools and families and to tackle children's issues with their parents.
<h3><b>Bucharest</b></h3>
The story of a mother whose daughter is enrolled in one of the after-school projects carried out with the help of World Vision at school number 126, sector 5 in Bucharest, helps to immediately understand the importance of these initiatives, for the children and their parents alike.

“When it was time to send our daughter to school, we wondered how we would manage. I thought I would have to give up my job to follow her properly, but it would have been hard to get by without my salary”.

The after-school service allowed her to avoid having to make a very difficult choice.

A teacher actively working for the program underlines the importance of helping children with their homework: “Many parents do not have the necessary competence, the time or the capability to help their children study”. The school director cannot hide her enthusiasm for the program and adds that the spreading of the programs on a national level should be perceived as a need rather than a possibility.

Bucharest's school 126 is in good conditions, the rooms for the after-school are adequately equipped, the children are well dressed. Of course, the area is not exceptionally poor and the children do not come from disadvantaged families. However, in the cities often both parents work away from home and it is not always possible to rely on the grand-parents: it is here that an after-school service avoids children being left alone and allows them to play and study in a peaceful environment.

The after-school program can also help the children whose parent/s has/have emigrated abroad in search of a job. It can practically be a measure of contributing to the welfare vacuums created, for instance, by mothers who have emigrated to work as caregivers in Italy or other European countries.
<h3><b>In the country</b></h3>
In Drăxeni, a small town 300 kilometers North-East of Bucharest in the district of Vaslui and one of the poorest areas of Romania, the situation is very much different. Here, a hot meal is a determining incentive to send children to school, while doing their homework and playing with their friends in the after-school avoids them having to start working at an early age.

The building for the after-school program has been restored and the room where the children carry out their activities has been recently refurnished. There is no running water in the school, however, as in the other houses in the area. The bathroom is a trench a few feet away from the school. The water is carried in tanks from a fountain on the town's main street. The heaters are wood stoves. The teachers have trouble getting to school, especially during winter. There is no work - besides working the land - and most families survive on the meager subsidies they receive from the Romanian government.

“My parents work in the fields around the house and we are six brothers and sisters”, tells a student. “My older brother helps my father, my sister works in the garden with my mother, I take care of my younger brothers and sisters and that’s how we manage”.

In a place where school children are perceived as a resource for the family, many parents are reluctant about the after-school programs.

“When the program started last fall, I said I was not convinced and that I would probably have drop out starting from the spring”, tells a mother from Drăxeni. “I didn’t know whom to leave my baby daughter with and I was counting on her to do it. But then I noticed she really enjoyed her after-school… And I couldn’t but let her continue”.

It is the same parents who openly admit they cannot help their own children with their homework. Seeing them come home happy and half-way with their homework done is an important incentive for those parents who believe their children’s education is important.

<a id="eztoc874405_0_5" name="eztoc874405_0_5"></a>
<h3><a id="eztoc871522_0_5" name="eztoc871522_0_5"></a><b>A matter of resources</b></h3>
Experts in the field and the parents who have benefited firsthand from the after-school programs widely recognize their importance. It is very likely that this same consensus has persuaded Prime Minister Victor Ponta to state that the after-school could be introduced in the “roll and milk” stead.

Last spring’s debate seems to have concluded with the obvious statement that an after-school program that includes a hot meal and overtime for the teachers is more expensive than the bread and milk given to the children mid-morning. It is, however, misleading to think that “roll and milk” and after-school are measures alternative to each other.

The political statement underlining the importance of the after-school program and expanding it starting from the places where it is most needed, in collaboration with the local authorities and international NGOs, could have laid the foundations for a longer distance to run. The public-private co-financing also, with lower rates according to income, would allow to expand the programs to the cities. This would be vital in the reintegration of the mothers in the working world, along with helping the children in their education.

Students have gone back to school. It would be about time for the government to do its homework as well and seriously evaluate the best ways to expand a program that meets the needs of all people in society. A reflection that needs to be done also outside Romanian borders.

It develops around the journey of Osip and Nadezhda Mandelstam in the Caucasus in 1930 (at the basis of Osip's "Journey to Armenia") and more in general around the life of the Mandelstams. At the same time, it is also a journey from Abkhazia to Nagorno Karabakh across today's Caucasus.

The project went through many stages and different concepts, but unfortunately we haven't managed to find appropriate funding to make it real.

Least all the work we've done remains forgotten in a drawer, we've decided to publish some of the working materials. They're all available on <em>Osservatorio</em>'s website in <a href="http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/Dossier/Viaggio-in-Armenia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Italian</a> and <a href="http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Dossiers/Journey-to-Armenia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">English</a>.

The most enjoable part of it all is probably the multimedia script, which includes photo and video materials mostly gathered by me as "visual notes" on the planned shooting locations. <a href="http://giorgiocomai.eu/mandelstam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Follow this link and enjoy the experience</a>.

If you're not familiar with the story of Osip and Nadezhda Mandelstam, before heading to the <a href="http://www.scrollkit.com/s/7rWaTa1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multimedia script</a> (or the <a href="http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Dossiers/Journey-to-Armenia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other materials published on the project's page</a>), I warmly suggest reading this short note about them.

<b>"Osip Mandelstam</b>, considered by Nobel prize winner Joseph Brodsky “the greatest Russian poet of the twentieth century”, was born in Warsaw in 1891 into a Jewish family. After a childhood and adolescence in Saint Petersburg, he completed his studies at the Sorbonne in Paris and at the University of Heidelberg. He was one of the founders of the avant-garde literary movement of acmeism which Anna Akhmatova and Nikolai Stepanovich Gumilev also belonged to.

In his lifetime Mandelstam published several collections of poetry, prose, memoirs and literary essays. Fascinated by Italy, he chose Dante to expose his own poetics, dedicating his famous <i>Conversation</i> to the Tuscan poet.

In 1933 he wrote the<i> Stalin</i> <i>Epigram, </i>a<i> </i>poem strongly critical of the dictator and the communist regime. The poem led to his arrest, deportation and sentencing to hard labour in a Siberian gulag where he died, probably towards the end of 1938.

Following the sentence by the soviet authorities, his work disappeared from public circulation. His wife <b>Nadezhda Mandelstam</b> (Saratov 1899 – Moscow 1980), who escaped arrest, managed to conceal numerous texts and, not trusting paper, preserved most of Osip's poems by memorising them.

To describe her own ordeal, Nadezhda published two memoirs in the 70s (<i>Hope Against Hope </i>and <i>Hope Abandoned</i>), which give one of the clearest descriptions of the mechanisms of Stalinist terror. Drawing on her personal experience, the writer explains with the precision of reference to daily life how it was possible to arrest, deport and murder millions of people before the indifference (or complicity) of those who were spared.

The documentary script is based on her writings."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p lang="en-GB"><i>The Association Agreements recently signed by Moldova and Georgia are not identical. There may be very good reasons for the differences, but some are more difficult to explain than other, as emerges from a closer look at the documents actually signed in Vilnius</i></p>
<p lang="en-GB"><!--more--></p>
<p lang="en-GB">Geopolitical tensions grabbed all the attention around the Vilnius summit and the signing of the Association agreements between EU, Georgia and Moldova. Yet a closer look to the Agreements themselves might offer some interesting insight on the mechanisms behind the negotiations between the EU and its partners. Some of the differences between the document signed by Moldovan prime minister Iurie Leancă and Georgian president Giorgi Margvelashvili for what concerns cooperation on social issues.</p>

<h2>The discriminated anti-discrimination paragraph</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">Looking at Title VI, Chapter 14, art. 349, of <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/georgia/assoagreement/assoagreement-2013_en.htm">Georgia's Association Agreement</a>, we read that “cooperation, based on exchange of information and best practices may cover a selected number of issues to be identified among the following areas”; in the lists, there is a reference to “equal opportunities and antidiscrimination, aiming at enhancing gender equality and ensuring equal opportunities between women and men, as well as combating discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation”.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">If we look at Title IV, Chapter 4, art. 32, of the <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/moldova/assoagreement/assoagreement-2013_en.htm">Agreement sign</a><a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/moldova/assoagreement/assoagreement-2013_en.htm">ed</a><a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/moldova/assoagreement/assoagreement-2013_en.htm"> by Moldova</a>, we read that cooperation may cover “equal opportunities, aiming at enhancing gender equality and ensuring equal opportunities between women and men, as well as combating discrimination on all grounds.”</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Comparing the Agreements, we get the feeling that the two paragraphs were the same in a previous draft (most other paragraphs in the same article are exactly the same in both Agreements), but that one of the parties asked for a change. In this case, the “suspect” is Moldova, which apparently didn't like the explicit reference to “sexual orientation”; instead, the parties settled for a generic “combating discrimination on all grounds”.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Since the issue of LGBT rights has been at the centre of <a href="http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Moldavia/Moldavia-contro-le-discriminazioni-LGBT-esclusi-120609">legislative contention in Moldova</a>, and even <a href="http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Media/Galleries/Church-Led-Violence-at-Anti-Homophobia-Event-in-Tbilisi">violent confrontation</a> in Georgia, it comes as no surprise that the wording of this paragraph received specific attention. Anyway, given that the unbinding formulation of the article does not compel action or active cooperation on issues of discrimination in either case, this may be taken as a minor difference (even if not insignificant), with no practical consequence and probably due to the over-sensibility of some of the negotiators.</p>

<h2>Who left the children out?</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">A thorough comparison of the Agreements would certainly show a vast number of such dissimilarities: the agreements are close to one thousand pages. Anyway, there is another difference that is at the same time more striking and more difficult to explain.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">The Association Agreement between the EU and Moldova includes a whole chapter (Title IV, Chapter 27) dedicated to “cooperation in the protection and promotion of the rights of the child”. Art. 138 states that “such cooperation shall include, in particular: (a) the prevention and combating of all forms of exploitation (including child labour), abuse, negligence and violence against children, including by developing and strengthening the legal and institutional framework as well as awareness-raising campaigns in this domain; […] (c) exchange of information and best practice on the alleviation of poverty among children […] (d) the implementation of measures aimed at promoting children’s rights within the family and institutions, and strengthening the capacity of parents and carers in order to ensure child development; [...]”</p>
<p lang="en-GB">In this case, the formulation of the article <i>is</i> binding: “The Parties agree to cooperate in ensuring the promotion of the rights of the child […] Such cooperation shall include...” implies that cooperation in this field <i>must</i> take place and, as stated in art. 139, a regular dialogue on child protection issues is to be conducted.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">In the Agreement with Georgia, the whole chapter is missing. In the whole Association Agreement with Georgia there is no single reference to child protection or child vulnerability issues.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">The absence is even more striking given that in the resolution adopted by the European Parliament in November 2011 on the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;language=EN&amp;reference=P7-TA-2011-0514">negotiations of the EU-Georgia Association Agreement</a> there is explicit reference to child protection. In that occasion, the European Parliament explicitly recommended to “include in the Agreement a section on the protection of the rights of the child.”</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Why is it missing? We are left wondering. It is difficult to imagine a negotiator standing up and saying “we don't want to cooperate on child protection”. Yet, something like this must have happened.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Certainly, Georgia has made important steps in enhancing its legal system from the point of view of child protection, in particular for what concerns the <a href="http://www.civilin.org/welfareeng/deinstitutionalization.php">process of de-institutionalization</a>. But is cooperation in this field so undesirable or unimportant to be left out of a 1000-pages agreement?</p>

<h2>Beyond trade</h2>
<p lang="en-GB">The signing of the Association Agreements have been commonly described in the press as a geopolitical choice, as a win or lose game where the winner would either be Russia or the EU. The Association Agreements clearly express a symbolic choice. But they are not only that. They are long, substantive documents, that have the possibility to bring significant changes and stimulate reforms in different areas. The EU has been a key element in supporting reforms in much of central and south eastern Europe.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Including in the Agreement a section on child protection, for example, gives to civil society organizations active in the field the opportunity to put pressure on their government and demand reforms. Indeed, a regional non-governmental coalition working on child protection (<a href="http://www.childpact.org/">ChildPact</a>) and a Moldovan coalition of NGOs (<a href="http://www.aliantacf.md/">Apscf</a>) already issued <a href="http://www.childpact.org/2013/12/03/child-protection-key-element-in-newly-signed-association-agreement-between-eu-and-moldova/">a joint statement</a> welcoming the inclusion of child rights in the Association Agreement with Moldova.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">Trade issues are a very important component of the agreements, but the majority of the titles in which the agreements are divided have no relationship with economic matters. This, supposedly, reflects the fact that the EU and the Europeanization process it promotes are something more than trade. Hopefully, much more than trade.</p>
<p lang="en-GB">If Armenia is not in the position to enter a trade agreement with the EU, both sides should make the most of the long negotiations that have been finalized in time for the Vilinius summit and include as much of them as possible in the new EU-Armenia ENP action plan. A high level of cooperation on all non-trade related issues is possible and should be pursued. Hopefully, this time the sides will agree that child protection is an important area of cooperation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Representatives of authorities in all four post-Soviet de facto states issued statements in favour of Crimea's referendum as an expression of the right to self-determination and declared their hope that this will contribute to a shift in international law. South Ossetia and Transnistria explicitly supported also Crimea's annexation to the Russian Federation, while Nagorno Karabakh and Abkhazia refrained from doing so, at least for what concerns official statements issued so far.

It is worth noticing that none of them declared in this context its intentions to follow the steps of Crimea and apply for accession to the Russian Federation in the immediate future (in spite of the fact that, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/03/20/how-people-in-south-ossetia-abkhazia-and-transnistria-feel-about-annexation-by-russia/">according to surveys</a>, this is the option favoured by a clear majority in South Ossetia and a plurality in Transnistria).
 
<!--more--><h2>South Ossetia</h2>
South Ossetia's MFA issued a number of statements regarding the situation in Ukraine. On 5 March 2014, it declared solidarity with the Russian Federation “in support of the compatriots in Ukraine” and drew a comparison with South Ossetia's own experience: “People of South Ossetia understand what is happening in Ukraine more than anybody else. South Ossetia suffered consequences of Georgian nationalism in August 2008, supported by clearly fascist Ukrainian organizations such as UNA-UNSO.” (full statement in English: <a href="http://www.mfa-rso.su/en/node/1025">http://www.mfa-rso.su/en/node/1025</a>; and in Russian: <a href="http://www.mfa-rso.su/node/1024">http://www.mfa-rso.su/node/1024</a>). In a statement dated 17 March 2014, South Ossetia's MFA commented favourably the results of the referendum and added that “the strengthening of the principles of democracy in international relations and the fundamental norms and principles of international law give reason to believe that the choice of the people of Crimea will be accepted by the international community, as the sovereign will of the people deserves.” (available in Russian only: <a href="http://www.mfa-rso.su/en/node/1032">http://www.mfa-rso.su/en/node/1032</a>) A statement issued on 18 March 2014 welcomes warmly the treaty signed in Moscow on the accession of Crimea to the Russian Federation. “We hope that this extraordinary event favours the strengthening in international law of the moral basis and the basic values, that for a few decades have been marred by the double standards demonstrated towards different countries” (available in Russian only: <a href="http://www.mfa-rso.su/node/1034">http://www.mfa-rso.su/node/1034</a>). South Ossetia's parliament issued an own declaration on 21 March 2013 supporting the decision of the Russian Federation (full text in Russian: <a href="http://cominf.org/node/1166501366">http://cominf.org/node/1166501366</a>).
<h2>Transnistria</h2>
The statement of Transnistria's MFA, issued on 19 March 2014, claims that the “Pridnestrovian Moldovan Republic is very encouraged by a decree of the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin 'On the recognition of the Republic of Crimea', as well as the address by the Russian leader dedicated to the accession of two new constituent entities to the Russian Federation: the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol.”

The statement highlights the similarities between the recent referendum in Crimea and Transnistria's 2006 referendum: “We are pleased to note that the result in Crimea’s referendum corresponds exactly with the result in Pridnestrovian’s referendum of September 17, 2006. At that time more than 97 percent of voters supported the independence followed by the Pridnestrovian’s free accession to Russia; more than 78 percent of voters took part in the voting. Such clear coincidence of the will of Crimean and Pridnestrovian people shows that Russian World revives and people’s wish for unity will not be inhibited.“

<h2>Nagorno Karabakh</h2>
Nagorno Karabakh's MFA issued a statement on the referendum in Crimea on 17 March 2014: “Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (the Artsakh Republic) considers the referendum held on March 16 in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea as yet another manifestation of realization of the right of people to self-determination.”

In the statement, reference is made also to referendums planned in Catalonia and Scotland: “The experience of recent years, in particular the referendums envisaged in Catalonia and Scotland prove that the recognition and realization of the inalienable right of people to self-determination is the most optimal and democratic way for the peaceful settlement of this kind of issues. “

<h2>Abkhazia</h2>
Abkhazia's president declared to Russian media on 16 March 2014 that Abkhazia “supports and recognizes the choice of Crimeans” and stated that “this is a classical example of when the will of the people is stronger than everything.” (<a href="http://apsnypress.info/news/11469.html">http://apsnypress.info/news/11469.html</a>).

Abkhazia's MFA did not (yet?) issue any statement specifically dedicated on the situation in Crimea. It did, however, reply poignantly to declarations made by Ukraine's interim prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk in the Verkhovna Rada. Yatsenyuk stated that (quote from the website of Abkhazia's MFA) “in Abkhazia on the background of economic dislocation and unemployment are rampant corruption, lawlessness, banditry and arms trafficking” and claimed this is what awaits Crimea if it joins Russia.

Abkhazia's MFA countered those claims, boasting positive developments that took place in the territory since Russia's recognition: “After the recognition of the Republic of Abkhazia by the Russian Federation the annual economic growth in the country became 13%, foreign trade turnover increased almost by 300%, incomes of the population increased by 450%. Recovery of social infrastructure destroyed by Georgian militias is at full speed. That is why Abkhazia is becoming more attractive to migrant workers from other countries, including Ukraine, Moldova and the Baltic countries - part of the European Union. The Republic of Abkhazia is annually visited by more than a million tourists from around the world. New hotels, restaurants, cafes and other tourist and recreational infrastructure are brought into operation. In 2013 the state border of the Republic of Abkhazia was crossed in both directions by about seven million people. Unlike the Kiev authorities, ethnic and linguistic diversity in our country is treated carefully. Chauvinistic principles of state policy are unacceptable in Abkhazia.” (full statement here: <a href="http://mfaapsny.org/en/information/?ID=2066">http://mfaapsny.org/en/information/?ID=2066</a>). In its final part, referring to the case of Crimea, the statement includes a note of support for the right to self-determination: “Returning to the events in Crimea, we believe that in these circumstances the citizens residing in the territory of the autonomous republic have the right to make self-reliant choice of their fate and political status of the peninsula in accordance with the universal right of peoples and nations to self-determination.”]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Gendercide in the South Caucasus </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class=" text-JUSTIFY"><em>“A boy is OK, a girl is not”. In the Southern Caucasus, male newborns outnumber females by more than 10%. Experts have no doubt that the cause lies in the practice of selective abortions, an already-known phenomenon in China and India. This clearly shows how gender inequality is still highly present in the region</em></p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY"><!--more-->Many more boys than girls are born in the South Caucasus – 112 boys for every 100 girls in Armenia and Azerbaijan, and every 111 girls in Georgia, according to a recent report by the Council of Europe. A slight disparity (of 105-106 boys for every 100 girls) is common and likely to be related to nature's attempt to compensate for the relative weakness of male newborns and children. In most European countries, statistics consistently register a coefficient that is close to this norm, with the Southern Caucasus republics and Albania (112) being the most significant exceptions. Worldwide, the phenomenon has been widely denounced in China and India where the practice it is certainly even more striking in scope. The word <i>gendercide</i> has thus come into use to refer to the millions of girls that are largely victims of selective abortion. In Asia, explanations for the phenomenon have related it to the one child law in China, the costs of raising a daughter in India, and, more generally, to the social and economic inequality between genders.</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">In the case of the South Caucasus, the anomaly seems to resist easy interpretations. According to official data, the ratio remained within the norm in Soviet times and started deviating in the mid-nineties. In 2000, it was above the worrisome figure of 115 in all three republics. Nothing similar has been registered in neighbouring countries (Turkey, Russia, Iran) or in central Asian ex-Soviet republics. First, it is hard to explain the phenomenon only by attributing it to patriarchal culture, which is certainly not an exclusive characteristic of the South Caucasus. Secondly, we are dealing with three countries with many commonalities, but also significant differences in terms of culture and religion (the Orthodox church is dominant in Armenia e Georgia, Shiite Islam in Azerbaijan).</p>

<h2>An under-researched issue</h2>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">The issue has been little acknowledged or debated in the region. Some researchers have dismissed it as a matter of incomplete registration of data following the demise of the Soviet Union. Yet, several studies confirmed the phenomenon and analysed data provided by statistics offices and research on fertility. A study on birth order in Georgia between 1997 and 1999 showed a distinct preference for males. In first-borns, the ratio remained within the norm (105). For the second-born, it rose to 108. For the third-born, it jumped to 140. Women with two daughters and a male third-born had had more abortions than the average. If the first two children were female, 42% of women planned a third. If at least one of the first two was male, the percentage decreased by half. All these factors clearly indicate preference for sons over daughters. Reports by health and demographic services in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia in 2005-2006 confirm this tendency, especially with regard to the third-born. In all three countries, the ratio was over 150 males per 100 females.</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">In spite of differences among countries and over time, there is no doubt the phenomenon exists. The issue was recently raised in <a href="http://bit.ly/tfugGk" target="_self">a report</a> presented by Doris Stump to the European Council's parliamentary assembly and dated 16 September, 2011. The report explicitly mentions Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, and calls for governments to measure the phenomenon and raise awareness among health professionals as well as the general population. “Prenatal sex selection is to be condemned as a phenomenon which finds its roots in a culture of gender inequality and reinforces a climate of violence against women,” writes Doris Stump. “It has harmful consequences, including population imbalances, a rise in criminality and social unrest, and an increased risk of human rights violations such as trafficking for the purposes of marriage or sexual exploitation.”</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">Widespread preference for sons is an apparent, as well as worrisome, indicator of gender inequality. As highlighted by Stump and demonstrated by the experience of Asian countries, where the phenomenon is older, direct repercussions of pre-natal sex selection are very concrete: a society where young men outnumber young women by over 10% – as is bound to happen in a few years in the South Caucasus– can create serious social imbalances.</p>

<h2>“I want a son, and will have one”</h2>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">According to Nino Modebadze, editor-in-chief of <a href="http://ginsc.net/home.php?option=allnews&amp;mode=1&amp;lang=en" target="_self">Ginsc.net</a>, a portal on gender issues in the South Caucasus, the phenomenon is caused by strong gender inequality. “Progress has been made in Georgia over the last few years and an equal opportunity law was approved,” she told <i>Osservatorio</i> in her office in Tbilisi. “But in our society, women are still regarded as second-class citizens... they have fewer career opportunities, lesser wages.”</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">If we take political representation as a litmus test, the Georgian case leaves no doubt – with 9 female MPs out of 138, the country has the lowest percentage of women MPs (6.5%) in the OSCE. “If you ask a Georgian man whether he wants a boy or a girl, he will certainly say 'A boy, of course! I want a son, and will have one'”, continues Nino Modebadze. “But the problem runs so deep in society that it is not talked about or acknowledged, and the media ignore it.”</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">Indeed, few are the journalists who paid attention to this issue. One of them is Tiko Tsomaia, who wrote about it in Georgian magazine <i>Liberali</i> as early as 2009. “In the beginning, everyone was just in denial”, she said to <i>Osservatorio. “</i>Even now, few want to talk about it, but little by little some started to acknowledge the phenomenon and take a stance...for example, representatives of the Orthodox church. But there is still a lot to be done”.</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">Therefore, the question remains: how to address a complex issue that resists easy, ready-made interpretations? In an <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta11/ERES1829.htm" target="_blank">official recommendation</a>, the European Council asked Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia to investigate the causes of the phenomenon, create incremental efforts for equal opportunities, organise and support awareness-raising campaigns, and provide health professionals with specific education on selective abortion.</p>

<h2>Why the South Caucasus?</h2>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">It does not come as a surprise that the Council's first recommendation was to thoroughly investigate the causes of this phenomenon. The (few) researchers who dealt with it in the South Caucasus have described it, thoroughly analysed available data, and convincingly argued for the connection between the wide disproportion between male and female first-borns and the practice of selective abortion. However, they have not yet clearly singled out the elements that put these countries at the dubiously flattering top of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_sex_ratio" target="_blank">male/female birth ratio world ranking</a>.</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">Selective abortions are allegedly more widespread in rural areas or, in the case of Georgia, in those areas populated by ethnic minorities. However, available data do not seem to support this hypothesis. In Azerbaijan, for instance, the m/f birth ratio is considerably higher in Baku than in areas bordering with Dagestan (in the north) or Iran (in the south).</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">A generic reference to “traditional values” (a phrase often used – and abused – to legitimise stereotyping of and discrimination against women or LGBT people) does not seem to be a valid explanation <i>per se</i>, since gender discrimination is equally or more endemic in many other countries. Relatively inexpensive technologies for determining the sex of the unborn child have spread since the nineties, but certainly not only in the South Caucasus.</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">Therefore, further explanations are needed. The widespread use of voluntary interruption of pregnancy as a contraception method in the USSR left an heritage of high abortion rates. According to <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3310607.html" target="_blank">some estimates</a>, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia currently have some of the highest abortion rates in the world. If the current trend persists, women in these countries are expected to have an average of three abortions in the course of their life. The significant difference between official data and survey findings suggests that most abortions take place in “non official” circumstances and thus, often with more risks for women's health.</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">Another crucial factor is the decrease of the number of children per woman. If a woman has many children, it is more likely that one of them will be male. In the mid-sixties, each woman had on average three children in Georgia, four in Armenia, and five in Azerbaijan. Now, these figures have drastically shrunk to two in Azerbaijan and less than 1.5 in Armenia and Georgia. Against this backdrop, parents who want a son know they cannot afford “mistakes” and frequently choose abortion if they are not happy with the sex of the unborn child.</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">These data show that a significant part of the population in the South Caucasus is ready and willing to resort to abortion as soon as the unborn child is found out to be a girl. “A boy is OK, a girl is not.” The fact that such a crucial choice in one's life – having a child – is so heavily conditioned by the sex of the child mercilessly exposes the pervasiveness of gender discrimination in these societies. Therefore, acknowledgement of the problem and an open, informed public debate would be important steps towards addressing an issue – gender discrimination – that is certainly not exclusive to the Southern Caucasus.</p>

I timori per quanto sta accadendo in Ucraina erano stati anticipati da vari studiosi. Ma cosa ha fatto l'Unione europea per limitare la crisi? E che cosa potrebbero fare le istituzioni europee per evitare che i cittadini ucraini perdano la fiducia nell'Europa? Un'analisi

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_20140522_135542.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74677872" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_20140522_135542.jpg" alt="IMG_20140522_135542" width="2000" height="2000" /></a>

“Amore in Crimea” (“Miłość na Krymie”) è, come recita il sottotitolo, una “commedia tragica in tre atti” scritta nel 1993 da Sławomir Mrożek, uno dei più noti drammaturghi polacchi del ventesimo secolo. È un testo teatrale ricco di riferimenti čechoviani nel quale ogni atto è ambientato in Crimea in un diverso momento storico; il primo nella Russia pre-rivoluzionaria del 1910, il secondo a fine anni '20 in piena sovietizzazione, mentre il terzo si svolge a inizio anni '90. Anche in questo terzo atto, come nei precedenti, dominano conversazioni assurde. I dialoghi trasudano pessimismo e decadenza morale. A un certo punto, due attori issano una bandiera americana.

A vent'anni di distanza dalla prima di questo spettacolo, tutto il mondo si è ritrovato a seguire un inaspettato quarto atto. Questa volta la Crimea è sia sfondo che protagonista di una nuova fase della storia russa. Come pubblico a teatro durante una rappresentazione di “Amore in Crimea”, abbiamo assistito attoniti a dichiarazioni senza apparente legame con la realtà e dialoghi disfunzionali, mentre sullo sfondo si issavano bandiere. Questa volta, russe.
<p class=" text-CENTER" style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p class=" text-CENTER"><a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_20140521_112040.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74677873" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_20140521_112040.jpg" alt="IMG_20140521_112040" width="512" height="512" /></a></p>
La straordinaria attualità di alcuni aspetti di quest'opera mi ha fatto riprendere dallo scaffale questo testo teatrale che avevo letto una decina di anni fa e del quale quasi non avevo memoria. L'avevo comprato quando per me, come per la maggior parte dei russi, la Crimea era prima di tutto un posto di vacanza. Ci ero andato nel 2006, con un treno diretto Mosca-Simferopol' e da lì in filobus fino a Jalta, per stare qualche giorno al mare. Affittacamere accoglievano a frotte i nuovi arrivati alla stazione degli autobus, mentre durante il giorno le spiagge artificiali vicine al centro cittadino erano affollate dai turisti. Strisce di cemento e recinzioni limitavano le spiagge private, in alcuni casi riservate ai clienti di sanatori sovietici non ristrutturati di recente.

Il russo era sostanzialmente l'unica lingua che si sentiva per strada o in spiaggia, ma l'uso della <i>grivnya</i> come moneta per gli acquisti e l'occasionale scritta in ucraino all'ingresso degli uffici pubblici serviva da costante pro-memoria del fatto che quella era Ucraina. Un fatto che all'epoca non sembrava più in questione.

L'attenzione di studiosi e giornalisti in quel periodo era tutta dedicata alla “rivoluzione arancione”, alle dinamiche che l'avevano resa possibile e alle lotte interne che da subito avevano caratterizzato il nuovo gruppo al potere, mentre la Crimea era passata in secondo piano.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_20140521_115010.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74677874" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_20140521_115010.jpg" alt="IMG_20140521_115010" width="768" height="768" /></a>

Negli anni successivi, però, in particolare dopo il conflitto dell'agosto 2008 in Caucaso meridionale e il riconoscimento da parte russa dell'indipendenza di Abkhazia e Ossezia del Sud, i moniti non erano mancati. Nel 2009 era infatti uscito un <i>Policy Brief</i> intitolato “<a href="http://www.fride.org/descarga/pb14_crimea-flash_point_eng_jul09.pdf" target="_self">Crimea: il prossimo punto caldo nel vicinato europeo?</a>”, a firma Natalia Shapovalova e Balazs Jarabik. Lo studio faceva notare, ad esempio, come il governo di Mosca avesse più influenza di Kiev in Crimea e che questo stato delle cose avrebbe potuto dare spazio a contese sulla sovranità del territorio. Gli autori sottolineavano l'assenza di una coerente politica per la Crimea sia da parte delle autorità di Kiev, sia da parte dell'Unione europea e degli stati membri. Registrando l'assenza di programmi di aiuto e cooperazione da parte di Stati Uniti e UE dedicati alla Crimea, il report esortava l'Unione a sviluppare una strategia di prevenzione del conflitto basata su dialogo, aiuti, investimenti e una prospettiva di integrazione ucraina nell'UE. Tra le iniziative proposte, scambi universitari, gemellaggi, facilitazione alla mobilità e all'incontro di giornalisti, cooperazione a livello di società civile sia bilaterale (Crimea-UE) che trilaterale (Ucraina-Crimea-UE) e lo stabilimento di consolati o uffici di rappresentanza delle istituzioni europee.

Uno studio del noto esperto di questioni ucraine Taras Kuzio pubblicato nel 2010 (“<a href="http://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/ebooks/files/372451918.pdf" target="_self">Crimea: il prossimo punto caldo europeo?</a>”) riportava, seppure con argomentazioni in parte diverse, la medesima preoccupazione per la Crimea.

Quando ad inizio 2014, approfittando della debolezza di Kiev, il governo di Mosca è intervenuto per annettere la Crimea alla Federazione russa, osservatori e giornalisti sono rimasti unanimemente stupiti dalla rapidità con cui l'operazione di annessione della regione sia stata messa in pratica.

C'è stato appena il tempo di rendersi conto che l'UE non aveva legami diretti sostanziali con la regione che potessero, se non influenzare il corso degli eventi, almeno contribuire a fornire informazioni affidabili su ciò che stava avvenendo. Un legame che forse avrebbe potuto esistere se si fosse stabilita una tradizione di cooperazione diretta tra istituzioni europee (o di paesi UE) e le autorità locali o scambi a livello di studenti, società civile e giornalisti.
<p class=" text-CENTER" style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
Le raccomandazioni ampiamente inascoltate di quel report del 2009 sulla Crimea sono in buona parte valide anche per altri territori contesi nello spazio post-sovietico, quali Transnistria, Abkhazia, Ossezia del Sud e Nagorno Karabakh, a prescindere dal loro attuale status.

Nel contesto attuale, il caso della Transnistria merita particolare attenzione. La ratifica dell'Accordo di associazione tra Moldavia e UE prevista per giugno desta grosse preoccupazioni in Transnistria, territorio de facto indipendente che beneficia ampiamente del sostegno di Mosca.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_20140522_142522.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74677875" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_20140522_142522.jpg" alt="IMG_20140522_142522" width="767" height="767" /></a>

Nelle quasi mille pagine che compongono il testo completo degli <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/moldova/assoagreement/assoagreement-2013_en.htm" target="_self">Accordi di associazione firmati tra UE e Moldavia</a>, l'unico riferimento sostanziale alla Transnistria si trova al Titolo II, art. 8, comma 2, ove si “reitera l'impegno delle parti a una soluzione sostenibile della questione transnistriana, in pieno rispetto della sovranità e dell'integrità territoriale della Repubblica Moldova”, si parla di facilitare azioni di “riabilitazione post-conflitto” e più in generale si ribadisce l'importanza della questione. Pochino, se l'intenzione è non solo quella di dichiarare il proprio sostegno alle autorità di Chișinău, ma anche di stabilire un percorso di cooperazione e dialogo con Tiraspol mirato a una soluzione condivisa e sostenibile del conflitto.

Esiste un dialogo sulla questione transnistriana che vede coinvolte sia Osce che rappresentanti UE. Non si registra però un coinvolgimento più ampio che includa collaborazione diretta con le autorità de facto, cooperazione accademica e scambi tra studenti o altre iniziative volte a favorire l'interazione e l'integrazione tra chi risiede, studia e lavora in Transnistria e cittadini di paesi UE. Iniziative di questo tipo esistono invece in abbondanza tra Transnistria e Federazione russa, che in sostanza diventa quindi il principale attore che previene l'isolamento della regione e offre possibilità di mobilità, studio e carriera ai suoi residenti.

La cooperazione con stati de facto le cui autorità non sono riconosciute a livello internazionale non è priva di ostacoli, ma molti sono i settori in cui vi sarebbe spazio per averne di maggiore.

Nel febbraio 2013, è stato pubblicato <a href="http://www.un.md/publicdocget/41/" target="_self">un report per le Nazioni Unite</a> dedicato alla situazione dei diritti umani in Transnistria, il quale evidenziava problemi in molti settori, dalla salute ai diritti dei bambini. Le autorità de facto di Tiraspol hanno risposto nel novembre 2013, approvando un “<a href="http://president.gospmr.ru/ru/news/prezident-pmr-evgeniy-shevchuk-podpisal-ukaz-kotorym-utverdil-plan-meropriyatiy-po-realizacii" target="_self">piano di misure per la realizzazione delle raccomandazioni del <i>senior expert </i>delle Nazioni Unite sui diritti umani in Transnistria</a>” in cui si elenca punto per punto come il governo intenda approcciare le questioni sollevate nel report (<a href="http://president.gospmr.ru/sites/default/files/zakon/prilozheniya_0.rar" target="_self">vedi allegato al decreto presidenziale n. 523, 2013</a>). Per alcune di queste voci, si prevedono riforme effettuate con risorse interne e si citano le tempistiche previste. Per molte altre, si indica l'apertura a collaborare con attori internazionali o si sottolinea la necessità di finanziamenti esterni. Ad esempio, facendo riferimento a centri per l'educazione inclusiva o iniziative a favore di persone con disabilità, si auspica la collaborazione tra ministero dell'Educazione, ONG locali e internazionali e si indica che progetti in questa direzione avranno luogo “in misura del finanziamento ottenuto dall'esterno”. I settori di cooperazione sono numerosi, da iniziative a sostegno dei malati di tubercolosi al processo di deistituzionalizzazione dei minori.

Programmi di cooperazione a sostegno dei diritti umani nella regione che, con il sostegno dell'Unione europea, coinvolgano organizzazioni della società civile internazionale e locale, senza precludere collaborazioni con le autorità de facto, potrebbero essere un primo importante passo per mostrare alla popolazione residente che l'UE si interessa del loro benessere, in linea con la missione UE di favorire la tutela dei diritti umani nel proprio vicinato. Scambi studenteschi potrebbero essere un altro passo importante.

Senza iniziative di questo tipo, autorità e media locali hanno gioco facile nell'indicare Mosca come unico partner su cui si possa fare affidamento. Per ora, l'Accordo di associazione tra UE e Moldavia e i nuovi accordi doganali con l'UE sono percepiti dalla Transnistria principalmente come una minaccia per la propria sostenibilità economica. In questo contesto, se a Mosca si aprisse uno spiraglio, le autorità di Tiraspol potrebbero cogliere l'occasione per cercare maggiore integrazione con la Federazione russa. D'altra parte, sono prontissimi: hanno già tenuto un referendum in tal senso nel 2006 e con una modifica costituzionale introdotta a dicembre 2013 la legislazione russa è direttamente applicabile sul territorio della Transnistria.
<p class=" text-CENTER" style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
Nel 2009-2010, mentre venivano pubblicati report che indicavano come la Crimea potesse diventare un punto di tensione cruciale nel vicinato europeo, io mi interessavo in particolare di politiche giovanili ed educazione patriottica in Russia. Oltre a partecipare a <a href="http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/aeer/article/view/1997" target="_self">campi “patriottici” organizzati dal governo russo</a>, in quel periodo seguivo costantemente materiali propagandistici diffusi dal Cremlino o da organizzazioni filo-governative.

Tra questi, <a href="http://youtu.be/Kvb6jYHMhrw?t=5m24s" target="_self">un video animato</a> realizzato per promuovere l'”anno dei giovani” nel 2009 mi sembra riassuma in modo esemplare la visione della storia recente che è alla base del consenso di cui gode oggi Vladimir Putin in Russia. Negli anni Novanta, oligarchi e banditi controllavano il paese. La gente normale pativa la fame e la Russia doveva farsi approvare il budget dal Fondo Monetario Internazionale. Poi è arrivato Vladimir Putin (nell'animazione, vestito da supereroe): in meno di dieci anni, la Russia non è più debitrice verso l'Occidente, le pensioni e gli stipendi vengono pagati regolarmente, il mondo degli affari paga le tasse, i ladri stanno in prigione, c'è pace in Cecenia e si è fatto vedere a Saakashvili chi comanda.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/10358210_1453559271549271_2136891732_n.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74677876" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/10358210_1453559271549271_2136891732_n.jpg" alt="10358210_1453559271549271_2136891732_n" width="640" height="640" /></a>

Come ogni buon materiale di propaganda, questo filmato include numerosi riferimenti in cui il pubblico si può riconoscere direttamente. Gli anni Novanta sono stati effettivamente un periodo straordinariamente duro per buona parte della popolazione russa. Quegli anni però non sono stati solo gli anni degli oligarchi, del banditismo, del crac economico e il periodo in cui la povertà diffusa ha raggiunto il suo apice. Sono anche gli anni in cui al potere c'erano i “democratici”, i “filo-occidentali”. Il fallimento della classe politica degli anni Novanta ha screditato in ampi settori della popolazione i “democratici” e i “filo-occidentali” come coloro che hanno portato il paese alla rovina... "democratici" e "filo-occidentali" sono oggi quindi in ampi segmenti della popolazione quasi sinonimi di ladri e traditori della patria.

Per fortuna – questa la logica conclusione di questa rappresentazione della storia – è arrivato Vladimir Putin a rimettere le cose a posto e dare nuova speranza al paese.
<p class=" text-CENTER" style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
Mentre seguo gli eventi di questi mesi in Ucraina, temo che “europeista” tra qualche anno possa suonare come “democratico” e “filo-occidentale” in Russia oggi. Il neo presidente dell'Ucraina, Petro Poroshenko, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/world/europe/frontrunner-in-ukraine-election-may-be-shifting-putins-stance.html" target="_self">ha recentemente ribadito</a> che per l'Ucraina “la principale direzione di sviluppo deve essere l'integrazione europea.” Per ora però, il governo di Kiev non ha il completo controllo su tutto il paese. L'Ucraina ha dovuto ricorrere all'intervento di FMI e Unione europea per sostenere il proprio debito estero. Il prezzo attuale del gas stabilito da Gazprom per l'Ucraina sta facendo lievitare rapidamente il debito ucraino in questo settore (ad oggi, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27374070" target="_self">circa 2,5 miliardi di euro</a>); l'insostenibilità degli attuali livelli di approvvigionamento energetico a questi prezzi potrebbe mettere in difficoltà interi settori dell'economia ucraina, nonché impoverire ulteriormente i meno abbienti (durante i negoziati con il FMI, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26758788" target="_self">il governo di Kiev ha accettato</a> di introdurre un aumento del 50 per cento del costo del gas per le utenze domestiche, con ulteriori aumenti previsti per gli anni successivi). Più in generale, il pacchetto del FMI è legato alla promessa da parte del governo ucraino di <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/01/ukraine-bailout-imf-approved-warns-risks" target="_self">tagliare le spese, aumentare le tasse, bloccare nuove assunzioni nel pubblico</a>, ed altre misure ben note ai paesi costretti a fare ricorso ai prestiti del FMI. Le condizioni potrebbero diventare ancora più stringenti se l'economia ucraina dovesse risentire della prolungata mancanza del gettito fiscale dall'est del paese, di un ulteriore rallentamento dell'economia causata dalla situazione di instabilità nel paese o da complicazioni nelle relazioni economiche con la Russia.
<p class=" text-CENTER">Vi sono molte perplessità sull'efficacia dei “piani di salvataggio” per i paesi in crisi sostenuti da FMI, Commissione europea e Banca centrale europea (la cosiddetta “troika”). Non sembrano esservi dubbi però sul fatto che il ruolo di affiancamento delle istituzioni europee al FMI in questa fase abbia ridotto notevolmente la fiducia dell'opinione pubblica dei paesi coinvolti nei confronti dell'UE. Paesi in cui tradizionalmente si era registrato un alto livello di fiducia nei confronti dell'Unione europea hanno visto un tracollo di questo dato: nella primavera del 2013, l'eurobarometro ha registrato che solo il 13 per cento dei ciprioti, il 19 per cento dei greci e il 25 per cento dei portoghesi dichiarava di essere propenso ad avere fiducia nell'UE (un valore che nel 2007 era rispettivamente al 61, 63 e 65 per cento). Un calo netto di fiducia molto significativo evidenziato in <a href="http://ecfr.eu/page/-/ECFR98_EUROSCEPTIC_BRIEF_AW_%284%29.pdf" target="_self">un recente report dell'<i>European Council on Foreign Relations</i></a>.</p>
<p class=" text-CENTER"><a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_20140522_103031.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74677877" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_20140522_103031.jpg" alt="IMG_20140522_103031" width="677" height="677" /></a></p>
La propensione filo-europea di ampia parte dell'elettorato ucraino sopravviverà al piano di “salvataggio” di <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2014/pr14189.htm" target="_self">FMI</a> e <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-279_en.htm" target="_self">Unione europea</a>? A giudicare dalle esperienze recenti, ci sono pochi motivi per essere ottimisti. Se i prossimi anni porteranno un calo di fiducia nell'UE comparabile a quello registrato nei paesi europei dove è intervenuta la “troika”<i> </i>nel quinquennio scorso, verrà a mancare anche il sostegno necessario per portare avanti il percorso di integrazione europea e riforme che in molti oggi auspicano.

È quindi cruciale oggi che l'Unione europea faccia tutto il possibile per fare in modo che la fase degli “europeisti” al governo in Ucraina non venga associata ad un'ulteriore riduzione del benessere, dell'occupazione e dello stato sociale o ricordata come il periodo dei “democratici” al potere in Russia negli anni Novanta.

<a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2014/pr14189.htm" target="_self">Il comunicato stampa</a> che ha accompagnato l'approvazione del piano del FMI per l'Ucraina, sottolinea, ad esempio, che “migliorare l'assistenza sociale per proteggere i più vulnerabili dagli aggiustamenti del prezzo dell'energia è un elemento cruciale delle riforme.” Un'osservazione condivisibile, ma certo difficile da coniugare con le contemporanee richieste di tagli alla spesa pubblica.<a href="http://europa.eu/newsroom/files/pdf/ukraine_en.pdf" target="_self"> Il pacchetto dell'Unione europea</a>, oltre a prestiti affiancati a quelli del FMI, include consistenti fondi a sostegno di sviluppo e riforme (1,4 miliardi di euro per i prossimi sette anni), in parte redistribuiti in forma di finanziamenti a favore di iniziative della società civile. È determinante che il sostegno UE contribuisca non solo ad attutire l'impatto dei tagli richiesti per i settori più vulnerabili della popolazione, ma anche a tutelare diritti fondamentali dei cittadini, offrendo inoltre benefici percepibili già nei prossimi anni anche in ambiti quali educazione e salute non esplicitamente inclusi nell'elenco preliminare dei settori di intervento.

Considerazioni riguardanti il formato degli aiuti all'Ucraina devono essere parte di una più ampia riflessione sulla natura stessa dell'Unione europea e un'occasione per ribadire che i valori fondanti del progetto europeo non sono e non possono essere liberalizzazione del mercato e stabilizzazione macroeconomica.
<p class=" text-CENTER" style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p class=" text-CENTER"><a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_20140522_140548.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74677878" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_20140522_140548.jpg" alt="IMG_20140522_140548" width="1536" height="1536" /></a></p>
Nel primo atto di “Amore in Crimea” due personaggi hanno il seguente dialogo:

<i>- Si può guardare solo verso le montagne o solo verso il mare. Non si può guardare da due parti allo stesso tempo.</i>

<i>- E chi me lo vieta?</i>

<i>- Le leggi della fisica, della geometria, della geografia, l'ottica...</i>

L'Ucraina sembra essere in una situazione simile. È netta le sensazione che non possa guardare alla Russia e all'UE allo stesso tempo, ma è difficile spiegare cosa lo renda effettivamente impossibile. Un'Ucraina democratica, rispettosa della diversità linguistica e culturale che la caratterizza, economicamente e culturalmente aperta sia verso i paesi UE che verso la Russia, con libertà di movimento per i suoi residenti in entrambe le direzioni, rimane un orizzonte a cui tutti gli attori coinvolti dovrebbero aspirare.

Nel frattempo, l'UE deve fare il possibile per evitare che per gli ucraini, tra qualche anno, “guardare all'Europa” non sollevi altro che rabbia per i difficili anni seguiti al 2014.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Kosovo's declaration of independence in February 2008 marked a change in Russia's approach towards Abkhazia and South Ossetia in the months preceding the war in Georgia in August 2008. Five years later, a short journey through this change in Moscow's official rhetoric</em>

<!--more-->

<em>Originally published on <a href="http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Russia/Moscow-s-approach-towards-de-facto-states-after-Kosovo-s-recognition-140382" target="_blank">Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso</a></em>

During the months that brought to the declaration of independence of Kosovo, Russian and international media have repeatedly mentioned the affinity between Kosovo and the break-away regions of the Southern Caucasus. Generally speaking, the countries supporting the independence of Kosovo stressed that it was a <i>casus sui generis</i>, and that Kosovo should not and could not serve as an example in other parts of the world, while Russian officials opposed this view.

After Kosovo declared its independence on February 17, 2008, and a number of countries recognized its independence, two apparently contrasting approaches toward this issue appeared in the Russian political landscape, one supported by the parliament, the other supported by the president and the government.

Just days before Kosovo's independence declaration, on February 14, 2008, Russian President Vladimir Putin held its “Annual Big Press Conference”, as the three-four hours yearly meeting with national and international journalists is officially called. Asked by a German journalist how would Russia react to Kosovo's independence declaration, Putin offered <a href="http://kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2008/02/14/1011_type82915_160266.shtml" target="_blank">a very lively answer</a>:
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY"><i>We think that to support a unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo is amoral and against the law. [...] Are you Europeans not ashamed to apply double standards in settling one and the same issue in different parts of the world? Here in this region we have Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria that exist as independent states. We are always being told that Kosovo is a special case. This is all lies. [...] What will we do if they start to recognize Kosovo's independence unilaterally, and will we not do the same? We are not going to start to play the fool. If someone takes a bad, incorrect decision, it does not mean that we should act the same way. But of course it would be a signal to us, and we would respond to the behaviour of our partners in order to ensure that our interests are protected. If they believe they have the right to promote their interests in this way, then why can't we? But, I repeat, we will not play the fool and act like this is a necessary consequence or do the same thing. We have our own affairs, and we know what we will do.</i></p>
An <a href="http://gazduma.ru/tema/19/duma210/" target="_blank">official joint declaration</a> by the two chambers of the Russian Parliament just four days later (on February 18, 2008), while not in open contrast with the statements of the President, supports the idea that after Kosovo Russia should change its policy regarding the “frozen conflicts” in its “near abroad”.
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY"><i>[The leaders of the countries that supported Kosovo's independence] will bear all the responsibility for the inevitable intensification of existent territorial conflicts and the appearance of new ones, [...] as well as for the destructive consequences for the whole system of international law and international stability. [...] Now that the situation in Kosovo has become an international precedent, the existing territorial conflicts have to be dealt with by the Russian Federation considering the situation in Kosovo and the practical steps undertaken by certain countries regarding the status of Kosovo. [The Parliament] considers that the recognition of Kosovo gives all the necessary preconditions for the building of a new format of relations between the Russian Federation and the self-proclaimed states located in areas of real (“estestvenny”) interests of Russia, first of all in the post-Soviet space.</i></p>
Just a couple of weeks later, on March 6, 2008, Russia <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/sps/648830C5AF867590C32574040046B653" target="_blank">put an end to the economic sanctions</a> against Abkhazia valid since 1996. Soon thereafter, the <a href="http://www.regnum.ru/news/975032.html" target="_blank">Russian Duma made its requests more concrete</a> and asked the government to take practical measures in relation to Abkhazia, South Ossetia (and Transnistria), including opening official Russian missions in these territories and making border crossing for local residents as easy as possible.
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY"><i>The Duma respects the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Georgia and Moldavia according to their internationally recognized borders. At the same time, the deputies think that the process of recognition of Kosovo that is already taking place goes completely against the norms of international law. Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transnistria, which during their existence as de facto independent states have become democratic countries with all attributes of state power, have much more rights than Kosovo to claim international recognition. [...] According to the deputies, in case of a possible Georgian attack on Abkhazia and South Ossetia, or in case of decisive measures to force the entrance of Georgia into NATO, it is necessary to take all measures to defend Russian citizens living in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and to consider the possibility of quickening the process of “soveregnization” (“suverenizatsiya”) of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The deputies of the state Duma, having considered the pledges of Abkhazia and South Ossetia ask the president and the government of the Russian Federation to consider the advisability of recognizing the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</i></p>
As <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/0/F524358D0CF5B814C3257420004D6591" target="_blank">stressed by President Putin</a>, Russia was particularly worried about Georgia's intentions to join NATO, and declared that also for this reason Russian support for these territories will hold “a practical and not only declarative character”. On April 16, some of these measures were made public with an official statement; in particular, Russian authorities and institutions were asked to recognize all documents produced by the “actual organs of power” of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This is particularly important because it opened the possibility for Russian companies to stipulate contracts with local firms without further complications, and put an end to the legal limbo that characterized most of these business relations. This might have been related to the winter Olympic games expected to take place in Sochi in 2014 (Sochi is located just a few kilometers from the Abkhazian Western borders).

A few months later, between August 8 and August 12, full scale war broke out in South Ossetia. Georgia's military defeat left the de facto governments of Sukhumi and Tskhinvali in control of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, along the lines that defined these territories in Soviet times.

On August 26, with a presidential decree, <a href="http://archive.kremlin.ru/appears/2008/08/26/1545_type63374type82634type205158_205744.shtml" target="_blank">Russia recognized the independence</a> of both Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and declared its intentions to establish normal diplomatic relations with these two new “states”<sup><b>.</b></sup>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At home they speak Hamshen, a variety of western Armenian. At school, they study eastern Armenian, as spoken in Yerevan. According to Sukhumi authorities, they will need to speak Abkhaz within a few years. Most of them, though, prefer to just speak Russian. An interview with Suren Kerselian, former president of the Armenian community in Abkhazia

<em>Originally published on <a href="http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Abkhazia/Abkhazia-s-Armenians-multilingualism-is-the-future-106982" target="_blank">Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso</a></em>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY"><b>The Armenian community is among the most important ones in today's Abkhazia. According to the latest</b><b>, but contested, data provided by Sukhumi's statistics office for 2003 (the equally contested results of the 2011 census have not been released yet), the entity has 45,000 Armenians, about 20% of the population – but much more according to other estimates. What are the main activities of the Armenian community organisation in Abkhazia?</b></p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">Education, culture, sports, family support, youth... everything a social organisation deals with. We are not a political organisation.</p>
<b>You started with “education”... what is the </b><b>situation?</b>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">Abkhazia has about 8,000 pupils of Armenian nationality – 2,000 pupils study in one of the 32 different Armenian schools, the others attend Russian schools. These are all state schools. Most Armenian schools have all 11 grades, while some – especially in smaller, less populated villages – have less, like 9 or 4 grades. In towns, even where there are Armenian schools, parents have started to think it is better to send their children to Russian schools. We would like for that to change, for more children to study in Armenian schools. However, it is not easy...schoolbooks are flown from Armenia to Adler [an airport in Russian territory close to Abkhazia]. Furthermore, there is a lack of staff, the teachers' average age is becoming higher and higher, so we have to hire Russian teachers for some subjects.</p>
<b>Why do people increasingly </b><b>prefer sending children to Russian schools?</b>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">It is very simple. Russia is a big, solid and neighbouring country with many study and work opportunities. Parents believe Russian-schooled children will be better off in furthering their education or finding employment.</p>
<b>What are the contacts with Armenia?</b>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">There are contacts, exchanges; we send students or teachers there for some catch-up courses. However, lack of roads forces us to fly. In addition, flying from Adler to Yerevan is twice as expensive than flying to Moscow, even if Yerevan is much closer.</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY"><b>Abkhazia's Armenians do not speak the language that is spoken in Yerevan though, but Hamshen Armenian...</b></p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">There are two Armenian literary languages – eastern and western. Armenians living in contemporary Armenia speak the eastern variety, while those living in Abkhazia speak Hamshen, a variety of western Armenian, but with many specificities. This happens because Hamshen people have been living separate from others (in the north of today's Turkey, between Batumi and Trabzon) for 1,000 years already. In the area, now live the <i>hemshinli</i>, Armenians turned Muslims. They speak basically the same language, although we have lived apart for over a century now, so there are some differences. The Turkish call them <i>hemşinli</i> and do not recognise them as Armenians...but they are – they acknowledge their roots themselves, even if they changed their surnames.</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY"><b>Therefore</b><b>, Abkhazia's Armenians speak Hamshen at home, but study eastern Armenian as spoken in Yerevan at school?</b></p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">Yes. When they go to school, they basically learn a foreign language. They do not use their native tongue, but literary eastern Armenian. With time, eastern-Armenian words have increasingly entered our daily vocabulary, also because that is the language of our newspapers and magazines. In Abkhazia, we can watch six Armenian channels on cable, including some broadcasting in western Armenian, which is very widespread within the Armenian diaspora, that mostly has it roots in Anatolia. In addition, many great Armenian authors have written in western Armenian.</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY"><b>Several years ago, Sukhumi's authorities approved a state language law that requires, starting from 2015, knowledge of the Abkhaz language in many areas;</b><b> e.g., in order to work in public offices. Considering the current level of proficiency among non-Abkhaz inhabitants, this law seems hard to apply, especially with this deadline.</b></p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">I believe a law protecting the Abkhaz language is necessary if we want to build an Abkhazian state – and we would not have fought such a bloody war if we did not. Moreover, those who live in Abkhazia have to understand that. I think inhabitants of France or Italy would not even conceive of living in a country without speaking French or Italian. If I think of Russians living in Baltic countries for decades and never studying the local language...well, it does not seem very correct to me.</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">This law aims at supporting the development and spreading of this language, but as a long-term objective. On our side, there are no complaints. We want our children to study Abkhaz, and in Armenian schools they do, but not enough. If they live here and do not study it, in 15-20 years they are going to have problems. For example, they will not be allowed to work in public institutions.</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY"><b>Yet, the most widespread language in Abkhazia is undoubtedly Russian. Basically, everyone speaks Russian.</b></p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">Abkhazia is a multinational territory where everyone speaks Russian. However, I believe it is important to develop the Abkhaz language for real, not only in principle. Sure, it seems easier to say “let us all just speak Russian” and not grapple with these issues. Nevertheless, we also need to think about this. When we take a flower and keep it in a book, it is because we value its importance and beauty. Isn't a language a precious heritage for all humankind? Anyone who supports Abkhazia also needs to support a language that survived for centuries in difficult conditions. If we give up on Abkhaz today, the same will happen to another language, then to Armenian, and maybe some day to Italian.</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">As regards the implementation of the state language law, we do need to consider realistic timetables. If we start by supporting study of Abkhaz for children who are now in kindergarten and they continue through their studies, they will eventually be able to speak Abkhaz. But this is going to happen in 15-20 years...and this new generation can legitimately be expected to master Abkhaz.</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY"><b>This means your </b><b>children will speak Hamshen Armenian, eastern Armenian, Abkhaz, Russian, and possibly another foreign language, like English?</b></p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">In Europe, speaking two or three languages is normal. So it is in most parts of Asia.</p>
<p class=" text-JUSTIFY">If the teaching method is right, speaking four languages can be normal, it seems completely realistic to me. This is what happens in other countries. For example, in Belgium many speak Flemish, French, German, and English...four languages. The important thing is to preserve your own language.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>It might be one page, one paragraph, or just two lines. But the importance of including child protection in EU’s Association Agreements cannot be overestimated</em>

<!--more-->On June 27, Georgia and Moldova will sign in Brussels the Association Agreements with the European Union that were initialled last year in Vilnius (Ukraine's new authorities are expected to sign only the economic part of the Agreements on the same day). After a high level meeting that took place last month between president of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso and Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili, both sides <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-372_en.htm" target="_self">officially welcomed</a> “the finalisation of the Association Agenda as a set of jointly agreed priorities for the period 2014-2016 that will help prepare Georgia for the successful implementation of the Agreement.”

The Association Agenda with Georgia and Moldova have not (yet) been made public. But if, as expected, they will reflect the contents of the Association Agreements, they will differ in at least one key aspect.
<h2>Looking inside the Agreements</h2>
The Association agreements signed last November in Vilnius by Moldova and Georgia are similar, almost identical in some parts, <a href="http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Georgia/The-Vilnius-puzzler-145329" target="_self">but not quite the same</a>. After the summit, the coalition uniting child-focussed NGOs in Moldova <a href="http://www.childpact.org/2013/12/03/child-protection-key-element-in-newly-signed-association-agreement-between-eu-and-moldova/" target="_self">could welcome</a> the presence of a whole chapter dedicated to child protection in the new Agreement with the EU. On the contrary, its Georgian counterpart <a href="http://www.childpact.org/2014/01/10/why-is-child-protection-missing-from-the-newly-signed-association-agreement-between-the-eu-and-georgia/" target="_self">had to point out</a> in a press release the absence of a similar section in the Association Agreement signed by the Georgian government. At a recent press conference in Chișinău, <a href="http://www.europalibera.org/content/article/25415619.html" target="_self">an EU representative stated</a> that the Agreement means “investments, trade, new businesses opportunities, development of the economy, but is also certainly good news for the children, because the European Union is a protector of the children.” He went ahead listing various forms of child vulnerability that EU-Moldova cooperation will tackle, adding that “this will not remain only on paper in the Agreement, but will turn into concrete actions.” EU officials in Tbilisi would not be in the position to make similar statements, since child rights have not been included in the EU-Georgia Agreement.

The chapter on “Cooperation in the protection and promotion of the rights of the child” is just one page in the 984-pages-long <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/moldova/assoagreement/assoagreement-2013_en.htm" target="_self">EU-Moldova agreement</a>. Can it possibly be so important? The short answer is “yes”. As recent history shows, child protection is one of those fields where EU neighbourhood and enlargement policies can bring real change to the lives of thousands of people.
<h2>Child protection reforms in Romania</h2>
In the early 1990s, after the fall of Ceaușescu’s regime, the terrible condition of the 100,000 children that lived in Romania’s orphanages hit the headlines, attracted strong emotional responses and significant international support. Yet, as of 1996, the number of institutionalized children did not decrease and Law 3/1970, that put institutionalization as the <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-009-9052-y" target="_self">second best child protection option</a> (after adoption), was still in force.

As recognized by child protection experts, things started to change in 1997, when child welfare came up clearly in the dialogue between Romania and the European Union. There is now a strong consensus on the fact that it was the European Union pressure that pushed the Romanian government to speed up its action and start a sweeping reform of the child protection system.

The importance of children’s welfare was expressed at high level meetings, but in order to become an official policy of the EU, had to be included in formal documents.

In 1997, the European commission published its <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/archives/pdf/dwn/opinions/romania/ro-op_en.pdf" target="_self">opinion on Romania’s application for membership</a>. It was a 114 pages document, talking about all possible aspects of reform, from the establishment of democracy to fishing regulations. In the whole document, there is effectively one single paragraph dedicated to child protection issues. In the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1999:335:0015:0021:EN:PDF" target="_self">1999 official document</a> “on the principles, priorities, intermediate objectives and conditions contained in the Accession Partnership with Romania”, there are two bare lines that highlight the need to “undertake a full reform of the childcare system.”

Obviously, it is not that single paragraph or those two lines alone that brought reforms to the system in Romania. But it is crucial that they were there, because they made clear that child protection must be a priority in the reform process and put pressure on the Romanian government to actually deal with this issue.

If those few lines on child protection were not in included in EU-Romania negotiations, it is easy to imagine that the Romanian government wouldn’t have felt the urge to proceed immediately with sweeping reforms. And if this didn’t happen, tens of thousands of children would have needlessly suffered, be deprived of the possibility of growing up in a family, and suffer the consequences of life in institutions (according to a well-known research, including <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674724709" target="_self">harm to their brain development</a>). Of course, politicians would have paid lip service to the importance of children, saying they are “the future of the nation”, etc. But in practice the situation of vulnerable children could have easily been ignored: they don’t vote, they don’t protest and, if left by themselves, they do not have any lobbying power.
<h2>Why not Georgia?</h2>
Back to the present. As mentioned above, the association agreement with Moldova includes a whole chapter on “cooperation in the protection and promotion of the rights of the child” (Title IV, Chapter 27). It makes clear that “such cooperation shall include, in particular: (a) the prevention and combating of all forms of exploitation (including child labour), abuse, negligence and violence against children, including by developing and strengthening the legal and institutional framework as well as awareness-raising campaigns in this domain; […] (c) exchange of information and best practice on the alleviation of poverty among children […] (d) the implementation of measures aimed at promoting children’s rights within the family and institutions, and strengthening the capacity of parents and carers in order to ensure child development; [...].” It concludes stating that “a regular dialogue will take place on the issues covered by this Chapter.”

The Association Agreement with Georgia has none of the above. The absence of any significant reference to child protection is all the more striking, given the fact that the European Parliament previously <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;language=EN&amp;reference=P7-TA-2011-0514" target="_self">recommended</a> explicitly to “include in the Agreement a section on the protection of the rights of the child.”

A few months ago, then Georgian Prime Minister <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DP0kVgKV2k" target="_self">Bidzina Ivanishvili stated</a> that children and the protection of child rights are “the most important issue in the world”; he later <a href="http://youtu.be/3zncKXfcjAg?t=2m47s" target="_self">stressed</a> Georgia’s commitment to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and expressed the hope that the international community would offer its support in this field. EU ambassador to Georgia <a href="http://dfwatch.net/new-eu-effort-to-save-street-children-in-georgia-35000" target="_self">Philip Dimitrov stated</a> that the “EU is focused on the rights of highly vulnerable children”, and that the EU is substantially contributing to projects in this field.

The commitment of the Georgian authorities and the EU is of course to be welcomed. But if both are so committed to child protection in Georgia and acknowledge the importance of mutual cooperation, why didn’t they include any substantial reference to it in a 900-pages-long document that is expected to be at the base of their relations?

Since 2005, Georgia went through a period of important reforms. The <a href="http://www.civilin.org/welfareeng/deinstitutionalization.php" target="_self">process of de-institutionalization</a> brought positive results, and the number of institutionalized children has been substantially reduced. Yet, as highlighted by recent studies, important problems remain. Georgia has one of the highest <a href="http://www.childinfo.org/files/Child_Mortality_Report_2012.pdf" target="_self">early childhood (0-5) mortality</a> rates among Council of Europe countries, 4 to 5 times higher than most western European countries. The phenomenon of street children, discussed in a <a href="http://www.unicef.org/georgia/Street_children_survey.eng%281%29.pdf" target="_self">Unicef report</a> and documented by an ongoing <a href="http://onnik-krikorian.com/projects/street-kids-of-tbilisi/" target="_self">project by photojournalist Onnik Krikorian</a>, is a clear example of child vulnerability and can be one of the most negative “side effects” of the process of deinstitutionalization, if not addressed by adequate measures. Disabled children are still often institutionalized, and until now have largely been left out of the reform process, as pointed out by a <a href="http://www.disabilityrightsintl.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Left-Behind-final-report.pdf" target="_self">recent report</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25575094" target="_self">a BBC feature</a>. Child poverty represents a big challenge; it is of course the result of the overall economic situation in the country, but there are serious proposals <a href="http://www.unicef.org/georgia/UNICEF_Child_PovertyENG_web_with_names%281%29.pdf" target="_self">brought forward by Unicef Georgia</a> that would help to significantly alleviate the phenomenon.
<h2>Taking action</h2>
There are many child protection issues that must and can be dealt with in Georgia. It is positive that Georgia is a country where different international organizations are active in this field. It is fundamental that Georgia’s government has shown sensibility towards this issue, has promoted important reforms, has <a href="http://www.messenger.com.ge/issues/2954_september_25_2013/2954_gvanca.html" target="_self">involved different Ministries</a> in the process, and recognised the need of more work to be done. It is very important that the EU is already <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/georgia/projects/list_of_projects/299085_en.htm" target="_self">supporting</a> <a href="http://www.unicef.org/ceecis/Booklet_ENG_HQ_2mm_bleed.pdf" target="_self">initiatives</a> in this field, in cooperation with local government and international NGOs. But it is regrettable that child protection has not become part of the Association Agreement, the main official document establishing the relations between EU and Georgia and their main sectors of cooperation for the next years.

Yet, current agreements and cooperation procedures do leave space for increased engagement in child protection. The EU and Georgia, both acknowledging the primary importance of cooperation in this field, should take this opportunity and make child protection in Georgia a clear example and beneficiary of the “<a href="http://www.eeas.europa.eu/top_stories/2011/250511_en.htm" target="_self">more for more</a>” policy (“the more and the faster a country progresses in its internal reforms, the more support it will get from the EU”). In the long term, this could provide encouragement to other countries of the region and give arguments to promote the drive for reforms in their own child protection system.

This could also be part of the process of increased <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlOsqSc7ZWo" target="_self">regional cooperation</a> supported by ChildPact - the Regional Coalition for Child Protection in the Wider Black Sea Area - according to which best child protection practices are horizontally shared among the countries of the region, with the input and support of the EU.

More directly, enhanced cooperation in this field could fundamentally contribute to establish a child welfare system able to break the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__uE0uViaLs" target="_self">cycle of poverty and vulnerability</a> and improve the lives and future of thousands of vulnerable children in Georgia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2004, the Carnegie Moscow Center published a book titled "Russia: the next ten years" [zotpressInText item="{KFM9HNE3}" and="and"]. In the introduction, Kuchins makes clear that the aim of the publication is not "to predict" what would happen in the following ten years but rather "to elucidate the context for critical choices for Russian policymakers and the Russian people" (p. 10). However, many of the contributors tried to picture the Russia of 2014, often presenting both a more optimistic and a more pessimistic scenario.<!--more-->

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/giocomai/14876980372/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-74677846 size-medium" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/14876980372_68d0f89d13_k1-e1407742156388-240x300.jpg" alt="Russia - The Next Ten Years" width="240" height="300" /></a>As it turns out, they have depicted quite accurately some of the main developments of the last decade. When multiple possible outcomes were outlined in sectors such as the establishment of democracy, freedom of the media, and relations with the West, the most pessimistic option turned out to be the closest to the reality of  2014. The fact that one of the authors could refer matter-of-factly to Putin's "pro-Western orientation" (p. 41) highlights just how much has changed in the last decade.
<h2>Domestic politics</h2>
In her contribution on domestic politics ("Russian power in 2014: an attempt at an intuitive forecast"), Lilia Shvetsova suggested that "irreconcilable contradictions will have accumulated by the 2008-2012 period, and society will begin looking for ways to pull itself out of stagnation" (p. 42). She proceeds suggesting that "there are two possible approaches to overcoming a hybrid reality in which incompatible trends oppose each other. The first way is to try once again to reinforce the status quo, this time by means of truly harsh administrative measures and force. The second way is to begin a gradual 'decompression' of the existing system of governance."

Indeed, the months preceding the 2012 presidential elections witnessed mass demonstrations in Moscow demanding change. Harsh measures followed, including both targeted (Aleksei Navalny, Sergei Udaltsov) and indiscriminate arrests (<em>Bolotnoe delo</em>), thanks to the fact that, as Shevtsova predicted, "Putin's new regime will be much more capable than the previous one of carrying out selective repressions" (p. 41).
<h2>Security and relations with the West</h2>
In his contribution, <a href="https://twitter.com/McFaul" target="_blank">Micheal McFaul</a> - later to become U.S. ambassador to Russia - pointed out what were the achievements of the decade <em>before</em> 2004: "Well into the 1990s, it remained unclear (1) if boundaries between new states would become permanent and peaceful, (2) if capitalism would ever take hold or (3) if democracy would ever be consolidated. Only a decade after this revolution began, two out of three of these transformations have been completed."

"Russia's borders are well defined today," he added. "The Soviet empire is gone and will never be reconstituted. Belarus may join Russia again, ((Interestingly, also <a href="https://twitter.com/DmitriTrenin" target="_blank">Dmitri Trenin</a> in his contribution suggested that "after president Lukashenko leaves the political scene, Belarus might join the Russian Federation" (p. 102).))  but the likelihood of coercive subjugation of states and peoples adjacent to Russia's borders is remote. [...] But the current regime is unlikely to use force to redraw state boundaries" (p. 45).

McFaul turned out to be too optimistic, even if he later added that "some borders may change" (p. 48) and got closer to the realities of 2014 suggesting that "the erection of an autocratic regime in Russia could even disrupt the relative peace and stability among states in the region, since a dictator in the Kremlin would have to rely on nationalist ideology and the military to remain in power - a volatile combination" (p. 49).

The developments in Russia-West relations were anticipated quite accurately by Andrew Kuchins: "Growing Russian power that features more aggressive behavior on its periphery - behavior that some will call 'imperialist' - accompanied by decreasing democracy will be a recipe for a more contentious U.S.-Russian relationship. In the near term these trends will likely not keep us from cooperating to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to fight terrorism where and when it suits our mutual interests, or even to expand bilateral energy ties. But in the medium to longer term, these trends, if they are not reversed, will erode the sense of partnership and negate any possibility of a broader and deeper alliance between Russia and the United States and the West" (p. 94).
<h2>Russia, the EU, and the shared neighbourhood</h2>
Referring to developments in Russia's relations with the CIS, <a href="https://twitter.com/DmitriTrenin" target="_blank">Dmitri Trenin</a> argued that "Moscow's long-term objectives would be to form a single economic space for the leading CIS countries, common customs and currency unions, a collective security system and ultimately, a common foreign and defence policy" (p. 102). The establishment of the Eurasian Customs Union years later is clearly part of this project.

He also hinted at the tensions to come between Russia and the EU about their role in their shared neighbourhood. "The European Union already considers Ukraine,  Moldova, Belarus and the nations of the southern Caucasus as its 'near abroad'. Russia's active policy in the CIS will lead to direct competition with the EU over the future orientation of these states. If Russia makes heavy-handed pressure and force part of its policy, Europe could again come to see Russia as a potential threat to its own security" (p. 102).

However, it is Putin's own policies as expressed in a document presented at a Russia-EU summit in Helsinki in October 1999 (quoted by  Hannes Adomeit in this volume), that most eerily anticipate what was going to happen. "Russia will counteract any attempt at hampering economic integration in the CIS. In particular, it opposes 'special relations' by the EU with individual countries of the CIS to the detriment of Russia's interests" (p. 115). Adomeit concludes: "It is too early to say whether the drift of the Euroatlantic and the Eurasian continental plates away from each other will inexorably continue or whether it can be halted. Optimism is unwarranted, however. Putin's course of managed democracy [...] appears to be overwhelmingly popular."
<h2>What about Crimea?</h2>
None of the authors mentions even passingly Crimea, war with Georgia, or the possibility of open warfare in Eastern Ukraine. Should we have known? ((In a way, it should be stressed, we did know. Maybe not in 2004, but as early as 2009 and 2010 we were told by various authors [zotpressInText item="{5C8GBSXU},{R7B6AC7X}" and="and"] that Crimea's sovereignty would be increasingly contested and that if no action was taken Crimea might well become the "next flashpoint in the European neighbourhood."))

In a recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/opinion/sunday/protecting-russians-in-ukraine-has-deadly-consequences.html" target="_blank">op-ed in the New York Times</a>, Timothy Garton Ash recollected a 1994 conference he attended, when a young Vladimir Putin intervened. Here's an extended quote from the <a href="http://www.koerber-stiftung.de/internationale-politik/bergedorfer-gespraechskreis/protokolle/protokoll-detail/BG/russland-und-der-westenbrinternationale-sicherheit-und-reformpolitik.html" target="_blank">full transcript</a> of the event published by the Körber Foundation of Hamburg (originally in German, my translation):
<blockquote><span class="userContent">"Forget not that in the interests of security and peace in Europe, Russia has voluntarily given to former Soviet republics huge territories, including territories which historically have always belonged to Russia. I am not thinking only about Crimea or northern Kazakhstan, but also for example about the Kaliningrad area.<span class="text_exposed_show"> The result is that now all of a sudden 25 million Russians live abroad, and Russia cannot allow - only in the interests of the security in Europe - that these people are arbitrarily abandoned to their fate. [...] So long as the world community does not pay attention to the legitimate interests of the Russian state and the Russian people as a great nation, there will always be forces in this country which will arise and threaten the stability of Russia. I agree with previous speakers that a stable Russia is in the interests of all."</span></span></blockquote>
[caption id="attachment_74677866" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/giocomai/4792531821" target="_blank"><img class="size-medium wp-image-74677866" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/unikalna-300x225.jpg" alt="Vladimir Putin poster in Seliger (photo: Giorgio Comai)" width="300" height="225" /></a> Vladimir Putin poster in Seliger (photo: Giorgio Comai)[/caption]

Vladimir Putin in 1994 was already outspoken about the fact that the international community should acknowledge Russia's legitimate interest in the fate of Russians living in its "near abroad". In 1999, just months after becoming prime minister, he made clear that Russia strongly opposes "special relations" between the EU and CIS countries, and that it will actively counteract the establishment of such relations. The message was very clear.

However, we should not use hindsight to selectively pick elements of Putin's rhetoric that are in line with current events, somehow implying that they just <em>had</em> to happen. Rather, this should serve as a reminder that, after all, Russia may not be as unpredictable as it is often claimed.
<h2>Thinking of 2024</h2>
Going through this collection of contributions written in 2004 on the  Russia of 2014, one might be excused to agree with <a href="https://twitter.com/juliaioffe" target="_blank">Julia Ioffe</a>, who, referring to Russia, suggested in <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116810/putin-declares-war-ukraine-and-us-or-nato-wont-do-much" target="_blank">a recent piece</a> that "all you really need to do to seem clairvoyant about the place is to be an utter pessimist." ((Of course, this is also a matter of perspectives. Many in Russia would claim that, quite to the contrary, the last decade proved to be successful in turning Russia into an economically stable country and an actor to be reckoned with at the international level; they might  think that such achievements go beyond their most optimistic hopes of 2004.))

McFaul concluded his contribution suggesting that in 2014 we might well be speculating about the future of Russia's regime, still likely to be "somewhere between dictatorship and democracy" (p. 49). But what about 2024? Given the amount of pessimism that currently dominates Russia watchers, applying the "Ioffe approach" to such an analysis is due to present an extremely gloomy picture of democracy in Russia, Russia-West relations and, more in general, of the security and cooperation environment in Europe in the next decade.

Policy makers, however, should be remembered that the script for the next ten years is not yet fully written. Anatol Lieven's remarks in his contribution about "Russia and the U.S. in the southern Caucasus", seem to be no less valid in 2014 than when they were written in 2004. They refer to the U.S, but apply also to Russia-EU relations in their shared neighbourhood. "Failures of both Russian and American strategy over the past decade should lead to greater modesty and wisdom in both Russia and the U.S. Neither country is going to be able to shape the region as it would wish. Neither has the resources or the will to establish an exclusive sphere of influence" (p. 129). Acknowledging this situation, both sides should opt for a more realistically moderate position, recognize their differences and try to engage in meaningful dialogue. ((Indeed, Anatol Lieven made a very similar point in a <a href="http://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2014/03/02/why-obama-shouldnt-fall-for-putins-ukrainian-folly/ideas/nexus/" target="_blank">March 2014 article published on Zócalo Public Square</a>.)) Or, as suggested by Lieven, "they can continue the sterile competition for meaningless advantage which has characterized the past decade, and which benefited neither Russia, America, nor indeed the Caucasian peoples themselves" (p. 130). Nor, I would add in 2014, the posturing of Russia, EU and the U.S. about Ukraine will bring benefits either to Russia, the EU, the U.S., or residents of Ukraine themselves.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The language laws introduced in Moldova in 1989 are frequently mentioned in publications dealing with inter-ethnic relations or language issues in the country or with language policies in the post-Soviet space more in general (a short reference list is included at the end of the post).

Understandably, none of them presents in detail each of these laws. However, for my own research, I decided to go through some of them. ((A more comprehensive list is available at this address: <a href="http://interethnicmoldova.wordpress.com/legislation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://interethnicmoldova.wordpress.com/legislation/</a>))

Below, you'll find a short summary of the main provisions of individual language-related laws approved in 1989-1990, or later amendments and clarifications. Translations are my own and brevity comes necessarily at the expense of details, so I included links to the original texts for further inspection.<!--more-->

Of particular interest might be the choice of introducing language proficiency tests for anybody working in contact with the public (Law 3465, art. 7). After some years of debate, the provision was finally repealed (Decision 324, 1995).
<h2>LEGE Nr. 3462 din 31.08.1989 cu privirea la revenirea limbii moldoveneşti la grafia latină [On the reintroduction of the Latin script to the Moldovan language]</h2>

Decision on how to apply law 3462.  Introduces the law in stages:
<ul>
 	<li>1989-1993: switch to the Latin script in the political, social, economic and cultural life of the republic; technical preparation to the switch, publication of all relevant materials for education; introduction of the alphabet “on the visual information media” (apparently, according to article 29, law 3465, reference to ads and text in public spaces, signals, etc.).</li>
 	<li>1994-1995: finalisation of the switch, including in the organs of power, judiciary, postal service, distribution of new identity cards.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Newspapers and magazines during the transition period can be edited using Slavic script, upon request of authors or subscribers.</li>
 	<li>Council of ministers of Moldovan SSR will introduce measure for the introduction in stages of the Latin script.</li>

“With the aim of terminating the deformations that appeared in the linguistic construction in the Moldovan SSR, of taking under protection of the state the Moldovan language – one of the fundamental premises of the existence of the Moldovan nation in the framework of its sovereign nation-state formation - and of assuring its functioning in all the sphere in the territory of the Moldovan SSR...” -&gt;

<ul>
 	<li>In the introduction, reference to the “really existing Moldo-Romanian linguistic identity”</li>
 	<li>art. 3, Russian language is to be used along the state language, guaranteeing an effective national-Russian, and Russian-national bilingualism.</li>
 	<li>art. 7, knowledge requirements  of Moldovan, Russian, and Gagauz language for areas where Gagauz live, will be established for all those who work in jobs that include interaction with the public (from health to trade), no matter national belonging. Level of the relevant languages need to be sufficient to conduct the activity or business, , in order to leave to the citizen the opportunity to speak whatever language she wishes. ((Notice that this provision introduces the principle that anyone working in contact with the public, be it a public administration worker, shopkeeper or taxi-driver, should be able to speak both Russian and Moldovan. In the situation of asymmetric bilingualism found at the time in Moldova - a vast majority of Moldovan-speakers were fluent in Russian, while most Russian speakers did not speak Moldovan - this provision could be perceived as thretening to Russian speakers. An additional measure taken in April 1990 (see Decision 110 below) introduces language testing for those who interact with the public in their professional capacity.))</li>
 	<li>art. 9, The state language will be progressively introduced in all state state organs. Documents will be translated into Russian.</li>
 	<li>art. 18, On education. Guarantees right to education at all levels in Moldovan and Russian, “and creates the conditions necessary for the realization of the right of citizens of other nationality who live in the republic to have education in their mother tongue (Gagauz, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Jewish, Yiddish, etc.).</li>
 	<li>art. 19, schools are generally monolingual, unless there are too few pupils locally.</li>
 	<li>art. 21, Moldovan language studied as a subject in all schools.</li>
 	<li>art. 29, public announcements are to written in the state language, and when necessary also in Russian or in other locally used language.

There is an exception for the territories of Transnistria (described with list of relevant districts), where many of the provisions of the law are to be introduced only in 1995. If need be, the supreme soviet can extend the deadline further.

Introduces language test to implement above mentioned language laws, establishing different level of language competence (from technical specific, to just oral) needed according to the occupation of each person. It makes clear that it is only required for those that need to speak or to deal with public, and that it does not apply to men older than 55 and women older than 50 do not need to take the test.

The tests test will be done gradually, starting with 1994. Heads of departments, associations, enterprises are responsible of making sure that law is respected. ((This law is eventually abrogated in June 1995 by <a href="http://lex.justice.md/md/296126/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HG324 din 19.05.1995, MO33</a>, see below.))

Regulates in more details the languges tests.
<h2>HOTĂRÎRE Nr. 36 din 01.04.1994 privind formarea comisiei parlamentare pentru studierea cauzelor care împiedică efectuarea atestării cadrelor sub aspectul cunoaşterii limbii de stat [On the establishment of a parliamentary committee for studying the reasons that prevent the testing of the knowledge of the state language]</h2>

Establishes a parliamentary commission for studying the causes the make it impossible to proceed with the testing of language knowledge.
<h2>HOTĂRÎRE Nr. 151 din 17.06.1994 privind măsurile de asigurare a studierii limbii de stat de către anumite categorii de cetăţeni ai Republicii Moldova în scopul îndeplenirii obligaţiunilor de serviciu ["On the measures to ensure the learning of the state language among certain categories of citizens of the republic of Moldova to carry on their work obligations"]</h2>

The above mentioned commission found that not all categories listed in the law can do the language testing, and lists the causes:
<ul>
 	<li>the social and political situation of the last four years has not been favourable to the study of the state language;</li>
 	<li>the deadlines established for studying the state language are not realistic;</li>
 	<li>the number of citizens that had to go through attestation has been arbitrarily increased;</li>
 	<li>the number of didactic cadres for teaching the state language, as well as their professional level, is not in line with the needs;</li>
 	<li>the programmes of the testing have not been coordinated with the materials studied at the courses, and proved to be very difficult;</li>
 	<li>Besides, they appeared too late, already very close to the tests;</li>
</ul>
The government will come back by 1 January 1995 with a proposal for dealing with the situation.
<h2>HOTĂRÎRE Nr. 324 din 19.05.1995 Privind aprobarea Nomenclatorului ocupaţiilor din Republica Moldova care intră sub incidenţa art. 7 din Legea cu privire la funcţionarea limbilor vorbite pe teritoriul Republicii Moldova şi a Modului de evaluare a gradului de cunoaştere a limbii de stat ["On the list of occupations that falls under the regulations of art. 7 of the law 'On the functioning of the languages spoken on the territory of the Moldovan SSR' and on how to evaluate the level of knowledge of the state language"]</h2>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At the latest <a href="https://twitter.com/ASN_Org">ASN</a> conference in New York I have been talking with <a href="https://twitter.com/sofiebedford">Sofie Bedford</a> about the rhetoric of 'double standards' in Azerbaijan and elsewhere. The conversation prompted a vary basic research question: "is it true that Azerbaijan's president has been using more and more the rhetoric of 'double standards'?"

Since it is exactly the kind of straightforward question that can be easily approached with a tool I have been working on recently that simplifies quantitative content analysis of textual materials available online, I gave it a spin... and here are the results.<!--more-->

The current English language version of the website of the president of Azerbaijan has 4094 articles published in its <a href="http://en.president.az/news/">news section</a>, starting with May 2010. They are mostly reports of the official meetings of Ilham Aliyev, and include the full version of lengthy presidential speeches and official declarations. This arguably constitutes the most comprehensive collection of Aliyev's speeches since 2010 available in English.

In all of these materials, 'double standards' is mentioned 107 times in 48 separate occasions.

The graph below shows the frequency of references to 'double standards' as a percentage of total words published on the website in a given day, calculated on a rolling average of 90 days to highlight trends and enhance readability.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/timeseriesDoubleStandardAzerbaijan902.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74678079 size-large" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/timeseriesDoubleStandardAzerbaijan902-1024x532.png" alt="" width="980" height="509" /></a>The same data is reported below in a bar chart that shows the absolute number of references to 'double standards' on the official website of the president of Azberbaijan on a yearly basis. Since the website currently shows only news published since May 2010, and I have included all publications until mid-May 2015, for the purpose of this post I divided the whole period in 12-months periods accordingly. ((The same data divided by solar years would result <a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/barchartDoubleStandardsPresidentAzerbaijanSolar2.png">in this graph</a>. The resulting graph is slightly misleading, as the years 2010 and 2015 are not complete. However, this shows that in the first five months and a half of 2015 there were as many references to 'double standards' as in the whole of 2014.))

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/barchartDoubleStandardsPresidentAzerbaijanMay2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74678080 size-large" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/barchartDoubleStandardsPresidentAzerbaijanMay2-1024x585.png" alt="" width="980" height="560" /></a>This brief analysis of official press releases and speeches published on the website of Azerbaijan's president makes clear that the answer to the question asked at the beginning of this post is 'yes'. In recent years, Azerbaijan's president has made more and more often reference to the issue of 'double standards' in official occasions.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It requires a big effort to stay up-to-date with academic publications in one's sphere of interest. I put together this post to make it easier to have at least a quick overview of what has been published recently in English-language peer-reviewed journals for those with an interest in post-Soviet, post-Communist and Eastern European affairs.

First, there's a list of the journals I think are most relevant for scholars focusing on this region, in no particular order (if you think I am missing something important, please let me know). You find it below.

Then, there's a Twitter handle: <a href="https://twitter.com/PostJourn" target="_blank">@PostJourn</a>. <!--more-->This will automatically post titles of new articles published on any of the journals listed on this page as they appear on-line. You'll find a preview of what is being posted on this Twitter account at the bottom of this post. If you have an interest in academic publications focused on this area, the easiest thing to do is to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/PostJourn" target="_blank">@PostJourn</a> on Twitter.

Finally, if you want to make sure you don't miss a single article, I I suggest you use an RSS feed reader. <a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/postjourn-feedlist.opml">Here's a file</a> that can be used to import at once all of the feeds for the journals listed below, without the need to add each journal separately. You can download it by <a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/postjourn-feedlist.opml">clicking on this link</a>. It can be easily imported by most RSS readers, such as <a href="http://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> (online based, here's the <a href="http://feedly.com/i/cortex">direct link to the import function</a>), <a href="http://www.rssowl.org/">RssOwl </a>(any platform), <a href="http://lzone.de/liferea/">Liferea</a> (linux only), or even email clients such as Mozilla's <a href="https://www.google.it/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CC0QFjABahUKEwjC0JuG6uzHAhVIiiwKHQ3lDkw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mozilla.org%2Fthunderbird%2Fdownload&amp;usg=AFQjCNHpdPt9eaKD0uSSBnmomXq2HSkifQ&amp;sig2=cdmyi3CB7A9qoCirXLTRyQ">Thunderbird</a>. Not a one-click solution (such as following <a href="https://twitter.com/PostJourn" target="_blank">@PostJourn</a>) but not impossibly complicated.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just more than a month has passed since Russia started its military intervention in Syria. There has been a lot of talking about the motivations behind the Kremlin's decision to take an active military role in the Middle East, and a number of competing explanations have been proposed. However, one element that has been frequently quoted is the Kremlin's desire to shift attention in Russia's media from Ukraine to something else, while maintaining the focus on foreign affairs rather than domestic issues. For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/timothydsnyder" target="_blank">Timothy Snyder</a> <a href="http://time.com/4054941/putin-russia-syria/" target="_blank">claimed that</a> "<span class="s1">the more important factor is domestic public opinion", that "Russia is a television culture", and that "Russian television has completely changed the subject: from Ukraine to Syria."</span><!--more-->

In spite of the frequency of such statements in analyses of Russia's intervention in Syria, I found no specific evidence of such allegations. This is why I decided to do some basic word frequency analysis of Russia's state broadcaster. Russia's (state owned) <a href="http://1tv.ru/" target="_blank">First Channel</a> is the main source of information for many Russians, and regularly publishes transcripts of its news stories on its website.

I downloaded and extracted all news items published since the beginning of Putin's third mandate as president (7 May 2012) and until the end of October 2015, for a total of 83.191 items. ((Due to technical reasons, a tiny fraction of articles may be missing. Given that the graphs are based on averages, this should not have a substantial impact on the overall results.))

The graph below shows the frequency of references to ‘Ukraine’, 'Crimea', and 'Syria' as a share of total words published on the website in a given day, calculated on a rolling average of 30 days to highlight trends and enhance readability. ((All derivative forms, such as 'Ukrainian', 'Crimean', or 'Syrians' are counted here as 'Ukraine', 'Crimea' and 'Syria' respectively. A rolling average of 30 days means that the data point for each day is in effect the average result for the previous 30.))

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/timeseries-news-PervyKanal-ukraine-crimea-syria-rolling301.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74679109" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/timeseries-news-PervyKanal-ukraine-crimea-syria-rolling301-1024x724.png" alt="timeseries - news - PervyKanal - ukraine - crimea - syria - rolling30" width="980" height="693" /></a>Even in recent weeks, Syria has not been receiving quite as much attention as Ukraine in 2014 and early 2015 (or Crimea at the time of its annexation). ((The early spike of references to Syria in August/September 2013 is related to the Ghouta chemical attack and in particular Russia's role in negotiating a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-23876085">chemical weapons disarmament deal</a> in the following weeks.)) However, it has clearly surpassed both of them in recent weeks, as appears more clearly from the following graph that includes only data for the second half of 2015. This graph is calculated on a rolling average of 7 days, in order to provide more details. ((<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/timeseries-news-PervyKanal-ukraine-crimea-syria-rolling-30.png">Clicking here</a> you can see the same time series, calculated on a rolling average of 30 days.))

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/timeseries-news-PervyKanal-ukraine-crimea-syria-rolling-7.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74679100" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/timeseries-news-PervyKanal-ukraine-crimea-syria-rolling-7-1024x598.png" alt="timeseries - news - PervyKanal - ukraine - crimea - syria - rolling 7" width="980" height="572" /></a>Here is another way to look at the data. The following graphs show the share of articles published on Russia's First Channel website mentioning Ukraine, Crimea and Syria.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/timeseries-news-PervyKanal-Ukraine.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74679112" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/timeseries-news-PervyKanal-Ukraine-1024x724.png" alt="timeseries - news - PervyKanal - Ukraine" width="980" height="693" /></a><a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/timeseries-news-PervyKanal-Crimea.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74679113" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/timeseries-news-PervyKanal-Crimea-1024x724.png" alt="timeseries - news - PervyKanal - Crimea" width="980" height="693" /></a><a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/timeseries-news-PervyKanal-Syria.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74679115" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/timeseries-news-PervyKanal-Syria-1024x724.png" alt="timeseries - news - PervyKanal - Syria" width="980" height="693" /></a>

What really stands out from these graphs is that for months almost half of all news stories on Russia's First Channel made reference to Ukraine. While Syria never reached that level of attention, in the month of October 2015 almost one quarter of news stories mentioned at least once Syria. Such numbers would be surprising for many countries, where the news cycle is dominated by domestic news.

Overall, this brief analysis shows that:
<ul>
	<li>indeed, Syria has become a common topic in the news on Russia's First Channel, with almost one quarter of news items making reference to Syria in the month of October 2015;</li>
	<li>in October 2015, Syria has been mentioned much more often than either Crimea or Ukraine (up to three times as much);</li>
	<li>Syria has never reached the level of attention that was dedicated to Ukraine for a considerable part of the last two years;</li>
	<li>Ukraine has dominated the news cycle in Russia for much of 2014 and 2015, with more than one quarter of news stories published on the website of Russia's First Chanell making reference to Ukraine for each month from March 2014 until April 2015;</li>
	<li>in a few months, almost half of all news items made reference to Ukraine (in particular,  the months of March 2014, July 2014 and February 2015).</li>
</ul>
In brief, while Syria has been receiving a lot of attention in recent weeks, and, indeed, it has replaced Ukraine as the main focus of attention in terms of foreign affairs on Russia's First Channel, the truly astonishing data emerging from these graphs is the consistently high level of attention dedicated to events in Ukraine for a lengthy period of time, from early 2014 to September 2015.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This post outlines basic information about pensions in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria, and the role of Russia in financing the pensions of residents in these territories. It is based on data and information available online, and includes references to relevant legislations and international treaties. All information comes either directly from official sources, or from news agencies quoting official sources.

<!--more-->
<h2>Pension Fund of the Russian Federation</h2>
The open data section on the website of the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation presents some statistics related to the <a href="http://www.pfrf.ru/opendata~7706016118-abroad" target="_blank">number of people living abroad receiving a pension from the Russian Federation</a> as of 31 December 2014. The breakdown by countries is not particularly detailed:

[table id=1 /]

Post-Soviet de facto states, including Abkhazia and South Ossetia (recognised by Russia as independent countries), did not make the list. Looking at these data, we have to assume that they are included in "other countries", and look for such information elsewhere.

As will be seen, overall support offered by the Russian Federation to pensioners in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria is substantial and local pensioners are well aware that their income is more or less directly sponsored by the Russian Federation.
<h2>How many, how much - Abkhazia</h2>
According to official sources quoted by <a href="http://sputnik-abkhazia.ru/Abkhazia/20150505/1014595264.html">Sputnik Abkhazia</a> and Russia's <a href="https://www.pnp.ru/news/detail/112276" target="_blank">Parlamentskaya Gazeta</a> there are 32 154 residents of Abkhazia receiving a Russian pension (the quote is from May 2015), and as of 1 January 2015 their average pension was 6 262 Russian Roubles (RUB), or about 92 euro. ((Throughout this post, the average EUR/RUB exchange rate for 2015 as provided by the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/eurofxref-graph-rub.en.html" target="_blank">European Central Bank</a> (68.072 RUB for 1 EUR) will be used. It should be highlighted, however, that in the last couple of years the exchange rate fluctuated widely, and as of 29 January 2016 stands at 82.2 RUB for 1 EUR.)) According to article 15 of the <a href="http://kremlin.ru/supplement/4783">'Treaty on Alliance and Strategic Partnership' </a>signed between Abkhazia and the Russian Federation in November 2014, however, the level of pensions paid to Russian citizens residing in Abkhazia was to be raised within 3 years of 1 January 2015 to the average level of pensions in the Southern federal district, i.e. 10 179 RUB (~150 EUR). On 14 April 2015 in Sochi a <a href="http://archive.mid.ru/bdomp/spd_md.nsf/0/F954A4CBE7573EFD43257F3A003DD0A7" target="_blank">specific agreement</a> on pensions was defined, which was later ratified by both sides and <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2015/12/31/abkhazia-dok.html" target="_blank">signed into law on 29 December 2015</a> by Vladimir Putin. The Russian side is to take charge of all related expenses.

The amount received by pensioners would increase year by year and reach the expected amount by 2018. On average, compared to 2014 level, the increase of pensions received by Russian citizens resident in Abkhazia would correspond to 598 RUB (~9 EUR) in 2015, 765 RUB (~11 EUR) in 2016 and 1 519 RUB (~22 EUR) in 2017. The estimated additional total expense for the Russian budget is 230 million RUB (3.4 million euro) for 2015, 294 million RUB (4.3 million euro) for 2016, and 584 million RUB (8.6 million euro) for 2017. ((Beyond pensions, there is also a <a href="http://archive.mid.ru/bdomp/spd_md.nsf/0/AE490660229B2EEB43257F3A003DD0A8">separate agreement</a> that similarly increases the salary of public workers in Abkhazia at the expense of Russia's budget. <a href="http://www.apsnypress.info/news/soglasheniya-mezhdu-rossiey-i-abkhaziey-o-povyshenii-pensii-i-zarabotnoy-platy-budut-vyneseny-na-rat/" target="_blank">More than 9000 people</a> are expected to benefit of the boast to salaries.))

Besides, residents of Abkhazia are also entitled to pensions paid by the government in Sukhumi. While there are a number of categories and levels of payments, most pensioners receive the basic pension of 500 RUB (~7 EUR) a month. <a href="http://abkhazinform.com/item/2591-vyplata-pensij-i-gosudarstvennykh-posobij-v-abkhazii" target="_blank">According to the latest statistics</a> (October 2015), there are currently 36 210 individuals who, having satisfied the age requirements, receive this amount. A <a href="http://www.apsnypress.info/news/abkhazskie-pensii-poluchayut-bolee-47-tysyach-chelovek-/" target="_blank">2013 re-registration process</a> resulted in 47 566 individuals receiving Abkhazian pensions at the time. In October 2014, Abkhazia's prime minister <a href="http://ria.ru/economy/20141004/1026863710.html" target="_blank">Beslan Butba claimed</a> there were about 11 000 people in Abkhazia who received an Abkhazian pension, but did not receive a Russian pension and suggested that Russian support would allow to increase the amount they receive (apparently, this has not yet happened).

While the numbers do not correspond exactly, it may be safe to say that there are currently about 32 000 citizens of the Russian Federation residing in Abkhazia who receive a Russian pension, and 11 000-15 000 other residents that receive the Abkhazian pension, but do not receive a Russian pension. ((At least some of them probably reside in Gali, and may be receiving Georgian government social benefits or pensions.))
<h2>How many, how much - South Ossetia</h2>
According to local officials, there are currently <a href="http://osinform.ru/53851-pravitelstvo-prinyalo-zakonoproekt-o-gosudarstvennom-byudzhete-respubliki-yuzhnaya-osetiya-na-2016-god.html" target="_blank">about 3 600 people</a> receiving a pension from the the government in Tskhinvali, with their number expected to <a href="http://cominf.org/node/1166507103" target="_blank">grow to up to 4 036</a> by the end of 2016. As of late 2015, the average pension is 6 221 RUB (~91 EUR). ((More details about the pensions paid to different classes of recipients can be found <a href="http://osinform.ru/39728-v-yuzhnoy-osetii-uvelicheny-razmery-trudovyh-i-socialnyh-pensiy.html" target="_blank">following this link</a>.)) It should be noticed that the level of pensions increased dramatically in the last few years; <a href="http://osinform.ru/23318-s-1-avgusta-pensii-v-yuzhnoj-osetii-uvelichatsya.html" target="_blank">in 2010, the minimum pension in South Ossetia</a> was only 280 RUB (~4 EUR).

According to <a href="http://www.pfrf.ru/branches/alania/news/~2014/08/28/4673" target="_blank">a press release by the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation</a>, in 2014 there were about 700 Russian citizens residing in South Ossetia who receive a Russian pension, a number that seems extremely low.

According to art. 8 of the "<a href="http://kremlin.ru/supplement/4819/print" target="_blank">Treaty of Alliance and Integration</a>" signed between South Ossetia and the Russian Federation in March 2015, starting with 2016 the pension of Russian citizens residing in South Ossetia must correspond with the average pension paid in the North Caucasus federal district.

It should be highlighted, however, that<a href="http://cominf.org/node/1166507103" target="_blank"> 92.2% of South Ossetia's planned budget for 2016 is financed by the Russian Federation</a> - Russia's total contribution amounts to more than 8 billion roubles (more precisely, 8 225 870 000 RUB, or about 120 million euro).
<h2>How many, how much - Transnistria</h2>
According to the data included in <a href="http://mer.gospmr.org/gosudarstvennaya-sluzhba-statistiki/informacziya/ezhegodnik-gosudarstvennoj-sluzhby-statistiki/statisticheskij-ezhegodnik-2015.html" target="_blank">Transnistria's statistical yearbook</a>, as of 31 December 2014, there were 141 300 pensioners in Transnistria, receiving an average pensions of 122 USD (~110 EUR). ((Transnistria's statistical office provides data in both Transnistrian Roubles and US dollars. Since the exchange rate between USD and Transnistrian Rouble has remained stable since 2012, for simplicity, data in USD are used in this post, using the average USD/EUR exchange rate for 2015 as calculated by the European Central Bank for reference (1.1095 USD for 1 EUR). ))

The number of pensioners is up from 130 900 pensioners recorded in 2005, but with significantly lower numbers of working people; in 1995 there were 241 100 people working in Transnistria, while by the end of 2014 that figure fell to 142 400. In other words, there is currently a one to one ratio: one pensioner for each working person in Transnistria. ((It is worth mentioning that out of the 142 400 people officially working in Transnistria, only about 78 300 work in the private sector.))

It is worth noticing that the average pension in Transnistria is substantially higher than in both neighbouring Moldova (1087.6 Moldovan LEI, or about 48 EUR, according to <a href="http://www.statistica.md/public/files/serii_de_timp/protectia_sociala/9.2.xls">2015 data of the Moldovan statistical office</a> and average exchange rate for 2015 as calculate by the Moldovan national bank) and Ukraine (1691.55 hryvnia, or about 68 EUR, as of October 2015, <a href="http://www.pfu.gov.ua/pfu/doccatalog/document?id=234133" target="_blank">according to the Ukrainian pension fund</a>).

Traditionally, residents of Transnistria (including Russian citizens) received a pension only from the Transnistrian authorities, and not from the Russian pension fund. However, <a href="http://president.gospmr.ru/ru/news/v-pridnestrove-postupili-sredstva-finansovoy-gumanitarnoy-pomoshchi-rossii-dlya-vyplat-nadbavok" target="_blank">since 2008</a>, all Transnistrian pensioners receive an additional component sponsored directly by the Russian Federation (commonly known as the <em>rossiskaya nadbavka</em>) as humanitarian support. As of 2014, this component was of about 15 USD per month, but due to the devaluation of the Russian rouble, its value decreased significantly in 2015 once converted to the local currency. ((Since 2012, the Transnistrian Central Bank has a policy of maintaining a stable exchange rate of the Transnistrian Rouble against the dollar around 11 Transnistrian Rouble for 1 USD. <a href="http://www.cbpmr.net/resource/DKP_2015_2107.pdf" target="_blank">The current plan of the Transnistrian Central Bank</a> is to keep the exchange rate in the range of 11.0-11.3 Transnistrian Roubles for 1 USD also for the period 2015-2017. This means that in recent years the local currency has increased its value compared to - among others - the Russian, Moldovan and Ukrainian currency.)) This form of humanitarian support from the Russian government has remained stable at around 1 billion RUB per year (about 15 million EUR at average 2015 exchange rate).

For the first three months of 2015, Transnistrian authorities have not been able to pay out in full salaries to public workers and pensions. Payments of the pensions has been restored <a href="http://president.gospmr.ru/ru/news/v-pridnestrove-postupili-sredstva-finansovoy-gumanitarnoy-pomoshchi-rossii-dlya-vyplat-nadbavok" target="_blank">since March</a>, when long-awaited financial support from Russia reached Transnistria.

Starting with Autumn of 2014, pensioners in Transnistria that are also citizens of the Russian federation received a form that would allow them to give up the Transnistrian pension, and start receiving a Russian pension instead. Thousands (exact numbers are not currently available) did the switch, but according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5etU4ahGR0" target="_blank">a 21 January 2016 news story by a local tv channel</a>, some of them would like to revert to the Transnistrian pension, since the devaluation of the Russian Rouble is having a substantial impact on their incomes (apparently, local authorities are contemplating options to compensate them for the loss). According to news published on <a href="http://novostipmr.com/ru/news/16-01-12/v-2015-godu-rashody-egfss-prevysili-dohody-pochti-na-milliard" target="_blank">Transnsitria's state news agency on 12 January 2016</a>, quoting Transnistria's Minister for Social Defence and Work, <a href="http://ef-pmr.org/" target="_blank">Transnistria's Unitary State Fund for Social Insurance</a> had about 90 million USD of deficit (its total expenses are about 220 million USD), but in spite of this, resources where found to pay all pensions and arrears, and slightly increase pensions for 2016. She also claimed that the number of pensioners decreased of about 15 000 individuals; even if she didn't explain the reason, this must broadly correspond to the number of people who decided to switch to the Russian pensions. ((The total number of pensioners in Transnistria has remained relatively stable/growing slightly in recent years (137 000 pensioners in 2010, 140 800 pensioners in 2013, 141 300 in 2014), so there is nothing else that would explain such a dramatic drop in 2015.))

It should be highlighted, however, that most of Russia's financial support for Transnistria comes through provisions of natural gas, without expectations of repayment. Back in 2007, as described by Isachenko [zotpressInText item="{AZA99FMA,66}"], "[t]o ensure timely payment of pensions and other social benefits, local authorities decided to borrow $US 14 million from the special fund that had been created in 2006 to accumulate gas payments directed to Gazprom." This was only the beginning of a new approach for finding resources for supporting Transnistria's welfare state that is by now established; <a href="http://www.mec.gov.md/ro/content/ministerul-economiei-raspuns-la-adresarea-4000-de-cetateni-legatura-cu-datoriile" target="_blank">according to Moldova's Ministry of Economics</a>, by 1 July 2015, Transnistria's unpaid debt towards Gazprom amounted to more than 4 billion USD (4 356 million USD). ((Chișinău knows this exactly because formally Gazprom sells the gas aimed at consumers based in Transnistria to Chișinău-based Moldovagaz (which is <a href="http://www.moldovagaz.md/userfiles/file/darea_de_seama_2014.pdf" target="_blank">50% owned by Gazprom</a> itself), which then transfers it to Tiraspoltransgaz, i.e. the gas provider to consumers and enterprises in Transnistria.)) In practice, simplifying the process, Gapzrom continues to provide gas to the region without expectation of repayment; money paid by consumers and enterprises for gas largely go to the state budget and are used to support public expenditures, including the payment of pensions and other social subsidies.

This happens in line with Transnistria's legislation, albeit without a formal agreement with either Gazprom or the Russian government. The <a href="http://zakon-pmr.com/DetailDoc.aspx?document=62002" target="_blank">original version of the law "On the peculiarities of payment for natural gas"</a> approved by Transnistria's parliament on 27 December 2006, stated clearly in its article 10 that all money collected for gas consumption should be paid to the company that provides gas; later amendments ((The current version of the law is <a href="http://vspmr.org/legislation/laws/zakonodateljnie-akti-pridnestrovskoy-moldavskoy-respubliki-v-sfere-promishlennosti-torgovli-privatizatsii-stroiteljstva-transporta-energetiki-i-svyazi/zakon-pridnestrovskoy-moldavskoy-respubliki-o-nekotorih-osobennostyah-osuschestvleniya-raschetov-za-prirodniy-gaz.html" target="_blank">available at this link</a>.)) changed that article, and introduced the possibility to transfer those resources to Transnistria's state budget. This is no secret: as recently as <a href="http://novostipmr.com/ru/news/16-01-29/prb-denezhnye-sredstva-s-gazovogo-scheta-rashoduyutsya-tolko-po" target="_blank">28 January 2016, Transnistria's president Shevchuk stated that</a> "'gas money' are a source for dealing with the deficit of the republican budget and the pension fund."

To summarise, pensioners with Russian citizenship who starting with 2015 decided to switch to Russian pensions in Transnistria (about 15 000 individuals, if estimates outlined above are correct) receive their pensions directly from the coffers of the Russian pension fund. But Russia finances an important part of the pensions received by all other 127 000 pensioners resident in Transnistria, either directly through the <em>rossiskaya nadbavka</em> provided in the form of humanitarian support, or indirectly, since the transfer of money that would otherwise need to be paid to Gazprom go to fill the about 41% deficit in the budget of <a href="http://ef-pmr.org/" target="_blank">Transnistria's Unitary State Fund for Social Insurance</a>.

Besides, according to official <a href="http://www.moldova.org/%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%82-%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE-20-%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BA-%D0%B8%D0%B7/" target="_blank">data presented by the news website Moldova.org</a>, there are twenty individuals living in territories controlled by Tiraspol who receive a pension from Moldova's government. According to news reports, the Moldovan government clearly recommends to demand pension from Transnistrian authorities, and Transnistrian pensions are substantially higher, which explains the low figures. ((Information available online, however, is not sufficient to clarify this completely. On the hand, it seems that people living in territories not controlled by Chișinău are not entitled to a Moldovan pension, on the other, there are apparently twenty people who do receive this pension. In theory, these might either be principled individuals who are faithful to the government in Chișinău and prefer to receive a lower pension rather than accept money from Tiraspol, or - in the lack of exchange of information among the sides - pragmatic individuals who draw pensions from both Chișinău and Tiraspol. ))
<h2>Some back-of-the-envelope calculation</h2>
How much does Russia spend overall to support pensioners in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria every year? Here are some rough estimates.
<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abkhazia</span>: as of 2015, considering 32 154 people receiving Russian pensions, of an average 6 262 RUB per month, for 12 months, we end up with a total cost of 2,4 billion RUB, or about 35 million EUR per year. ((In his excellent article on the political economy of post-Soviet de facto states, Broers  [zotpressInText item="{R2XZCMZH,18}"] estimates, without providing additional details, "annual transfers in the region of $70,000,000 to pay for Abkhazian pensions." The discrepancy is mostly due to the combined effect of the fluctuation of exchange rates of both US dollars to the EUR (on average in the first half of 2014, 1 EUR was exchanged with 1,37 USD, while today it stands at about 1,1), and Russian Rouble to both USD and EUR. This is an additional reminder of the importance of clarifying currency details in times of substantial fluctuations of exchange rates.)) If the number of pensioners remains stable, due to planned increased in the amount they receive, by 2018 this sum should correspond to about 58 million EUR per year. ((Once again, it should be highlighted that the RUB/EUR exchange rate applied is the average rate of 2015. Using instead the current exchange rate as of 29 January 2016, the value in euro would be about 20 per cent lower.))</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">South Ossetia</span>: with only about 3 600 pensioners, the total amount spent for pensioners in South Ossetia as of 2015 should be of about 4 million EUR (no matter if the pension is paid directly from Russia or from Tskhinvali's budget, we'd still be talking of almost exclusively Russian money), expected to grow to about 7 million EUR a year by 2018 considering the expected increase in the number of pensioners and in the amount they receive.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Transnistria</span>: for Transnsitria the math is slightly different. About 15 million EUR every year come as humanitarian support in the form of the <em>rossiskaya nadbavka.</em> But by not demanding repayment of gas, effectively Russia is paying the bill also for the about 81 million EUR (in 2015) deficit of the Transnistrian pension fund. The total amount will vary according to the deficit, and might well increase if more pensioners switch to pensions that are 100 per cent paid from Russia, but for the time being Russia is apparently spending about 100 million EUR per year to pay Transnistria's pensions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional information</h2>
<h3>Pension age</h3>
In all of these territories, the pension age is the same <a href="http://www.pfrf.ru/knopki/zhizn/~437" target="_blank">as in Russia</a>: 60 for men and 55 for women.
<h3>Russia's state budget</h3>
In Russia's state budget for 2016 (made public in the form of <a href="http://www.minfin.ru/common/upload/library/2015/12/main/FZ359-FZ_ot_141215.pdf" target="_blank">a pdf file composed of 2384 scanned, unsearchable pages</a> - reference to Abkhazia and South Ossetia at page 941) , there are 7 986 104 900 RUB (~117 million EUR) earmarked for Abkhazia and 8 225 870 000 (~121 million EUR) earmarked for South Ossetia. ((The number included in the Russian state budget under expenditures <a href="http://cominf.org/node/1166507103" target="_blank">corresponds exactly to the sum included in South Ossetia's budget for 2016</a>.)) Apparently, these do not include pensions paid directly by the Russian side, nor, for example, expenses by the Russian Ministry of Defence for deploying its military in these territories. There is no evident reference to financial support for Transnistria.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently created a big dataset of Romania's media (more than one million news items in total), in order to do some testing with larger datasets and to structurally check references to Transnistria in Romanian media. The dataset includes two newspapers (Adevărul and Gândul), one news website (Hotnews), one TV station (digi24) and one radio station (Radio Romania Actualități). <!--more-->When data are not disaggregated, an average of all the available data for the given period is presented (with each media source given equal weight). I'll analyse data about Transnistria in another occasion. In the meantime, just posting some tests…

Quick take-outs (no formal testing):
<ul>
 	<li>presidents seem to get slightly more visibility than prime ministers, but it might actually boil down to individuals… Basescu has been very much visible, but Ponta got even more exposure.</li>
 	<li>since late 2015, both president and prime minister are less visible than used to be the case under previous tenures → both Iohannis and Cioloş seem to be less of media persons than their predecessors</li>
 	<li>media included in this comparison talk more or talk less about politicians around the same time, and while there are some differences among how much each one is mentioned on different media, there are not huge differences (including different media sources in the analysis, e.g. Antena 3, might well give different results)</li>
 	<li>Ponta and Băsescu still get a lot of visibility, even in 2016</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Originally published on <a title="Link a Presidential Power" href="http://presidential-power.com/?p=5667">Presidential Power</a></em>

Presidential elections in Transnistria, a de facto independent state within the internationally recognised borders of Moldova, are scheduled for 11 December 2016. Out of a total of seven registered candidates, the two main contenders for the position are the incumbent president, Yevgeny Shevchuk, and Vadim Krasnoselski, who currently serves as the speaker of the Transnistrian parliament (locally still known as “Supreme Soviet”).<!--more-->

<a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2016/transnistria">Freedom House ranks Transnistria as “not free”</a>, yet elections take place regularly, are competitive and – as the 2011 vote showed – a serving president can lose at the polls. While media pluralism is limited, the work of civil society organizations is severely restricted (for example, interactions with external actors is to be agreed with the local ministry of foreign affairs), and those in power make extensive use of administrative resources to strengthen their positions, recent elections have been preceded by lively campaigns and outcomes were far from predetermined.

<strong>Previous elections</strong>

Since its inception with the demise of the Soviet Union, Transnistria had been ruled by Igor Smirnov, known for its authoritarian style of government that prevented any substantial form of contestation. Yet, with time both Moscow (a key provider of support for the region) and Sheriff (the holding company owning key sectors of Transnistria’s economy), grew dissatisfied with his leadership. When presidential elections took place in 2011, Smirnov ended only in third place. Yevgeny Shevchuk, previously speaker of the parliament and then leader of the Sheriff-supported party “Renewal”, won the run-off against Moscow-backed and then parliament speaker, Anatoly Kaminski.

During his presidency, Shevchuk has distanced himself from Sheriff and tried to establish an independent power block around his administration. However, Shevchuk-backers performed poorly at the latest elections to the Supreme Soviet in November 2015; formally independent candidates close to “Renewal” and Sheriff (and now in strong opposition to Shevchuk) won a strong majority in the 43-seat parliament, and elected Vadim Krasnoselski as parliament speaker.

According to key terms of reference of Transnistrian politics, the forthcoming presidential elections can thus be briefly characterised as a contest between an incumbent president with declining popularity (Yevgeny Shevchuk) and a speaker of the parliament backed by Sheriff (Vadim Krasnoselski).

<strong>Policies</strong>

The two key candidates do not stray from the main tenets of Transnistria’s mainstream politics, and ever closer integration with Russia is not a point of debate. They may have different views in terms of fiscal policy and a few other issues, but overall their programmes largely overlap, to the extent that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6I5qtbumaQ">in a recent talk show</a> Krasnoselski’s supporters accused Shevchuk of lifting policy proposals directly from the pre-electoral programme of his opponent.

During the campaign, both candidates insisted on their pro-Russian credentials, declared their support for pensioners (and claimed their opponent would cut pensions), accused each other of close ties with Moldova, and substantially dismissed the issue of relations with the European Union. However, keeping preferential treatment for Transnistrian exports towards the EU and ensuring that agreements on the export of electricity to right-bank Moldova remain in place will be a key challenge for Transnistria’s next president.

While much of the ongoing struggle is effectively among two power blocks fighting against each other for access to political power and economic resources in the territory, there is one main question at the heart of the electorate: who among the candidates is best suited to keep Russian aid flowing, keep the economy afloat, and thus ensure that pensions and salaries of state-employees are not cut?

<strong>Transnistria through graphs</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74680781" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cashIncomePMRpie-1024x865.png" alt="" width="980" height="828" />

According to official statistics released by Transnistrian authorities, of the total number of people with a registered cash income, about half are pensioners, one quarter are state-employees and one quarter are employed in the private sector.

A one-to-one workers-to-pensioners ratio is hardly sustainable, in particular considering the fact that pensions are high by regional standards (pensions in Transnistria are more than 50 per cent higher than in neighbouring Moldova and Ukraine).

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74680782" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pensionsTransnistriaComparison-1024x512.png" alt="" width="980" height="490" />

Transnistria’s authorities can afford this relatively high level of pensions and salaries of state employees, as well as a degree of public services comparable with that found in neighbouring countries thanks to support from Russia. <a href="http://novostipmr.com/ru/news/13-03-05/glava-pridnestrovya-my-hotim-rasschityvatsya-v-rossiyskih-rublyah">Transnistria’s president himself admitted</a> that Transnistria would be able to cover for only about 20-25 per cent of its budget without external support. Russia officially covers some of the expenditure for pensions, and sponsors constructions (in particular in the health and education sector) through a “humanitarian aid” programme, but the bulk of its help actually comes in the form of free gas. In brief, Gazprom delivers gas to the region, but does not demand to be paid for it. The total amount of debt accumulated by Gazprom currently stands at about 5 billion USD, or about six times Transnistria’s yearly GDP. In recent years, Transnistria received every year about 300-500 million USD worth of gas (about as much as the total size of budget expenditures), without paying a penny for it.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74680783" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/transnistriaBudgetGasAid-1024x512.png" alt="" width="980" height="490" />

Individuals and companies based in Transnistria mostly do pay for the gas they use, but those payments are kept as a subsidy to the budget. Accordingly, in order to transform free gas into cash for the budget, Transnistria’s economy must function: hard currency does not come from Russia, but rather from the export of goods (such as metals and textiles) mostly to EU countries and Moldova. Electricity produced in Transnistrian powerplants and sold across the de facto border with Moldova is also important.

In brief, the local economy would not be able to function without Russian support, but it also needs open trade routes towards Moldova and the EU to keep itself afloat (only about 8 per cent of Transnistrian exports go towards Russia). It is ultimately those exports that provide the cash needed to pay for the pensions and salaries that are a core legitimizing element for Transnistria’s leadership.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74680784" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/exportPMRshareArea-1024x512.png" alt="" width="980" height="490" />

<strong>What does this mean for the elections?</strong>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74680785" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dinner-with-Putin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="551" />

In order to demonstrate they can be trusted with ensuring uninterrupted Russians support, each of the main candidates boasts that they have better relations with Moscow, and have direct contacts with the Kremlin. The fact that Transnistria’s parliament speaker Krasnoselski was sitting “at the next table to Putin” at a recent reception, while president Shevchuk was not even invited, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtROZZWFMmk">was hailed by the Sheriff-owned TV channel TSV</a> as a clear sign that Moscow supports Krasnoselski.

In the context of limited pluralism that characterises Transnistria, the current balance of power allows for an unusually high level of contrast among candidates. Since last year’s parliamentary elections, the Supreme Soviet has served as a platform for criticising the president’s performance. The deadlock between the presidency and parliament stalled much needed reforms, for example, in order to deal with the ongoing currency crisis. ((While the Russian rouble as well as most other currencies in the post-Soviet space have lost half of their value against the dollar in the last couple of years, the Transnistrian rouble has kept its exchange rate unsustainably stable, with a number of consequences on the local economy, including shortages of currency.))

The year 2016 has been characterised by a constant blame-game between president and parliament that has been most noticeable on the two main local TV channels; the state-owned “Pervy Pridnestrovski” remained on Shevchuk’s side, while Sheriff-owned TSV openly campaigned for Krasnoselski.

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74680786" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/YouTubeMentionsTransnistria-1024x512.png" alt="" width="980" height="490" />

The two TV channels offered remarkably different perspectives on current events in Transnistria. TSV focused on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irdoOisyewc">Krasnoselski’s close ties to Moscow</a>, on blaming president Shevchuk for the ongoing economic crisis and on highlighting the perils of a looming economic breakdown if Transnistria’s leadership does not change. ((TSV also aired <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0QuA-XYrbY">a sweet biopic o</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0QuA-XYrbY">n</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0QuA-XYrbY"> Krasnoselski</a>, portraying him as a trustworthy family man.)) Shevchuk has also been accused of siphoning off large sums of money through an intermediary company involved in the export of electricity, and of conceding too much in negotiations with Moldova. ((<a href="https://youtu.be/plykQeOQfzE?t=2m50s">An analyst on Sheriff-owned TSV described it</a> as a “purely Gorbachev-style policy of unilateral and unmotivated concessions”; in a context where the demise of the Soviet Union is largely perceived as a great tragedy, this is clearly meant as an offensive and disquieting characterisation.))

“Pervy Pridnestrovski” broadcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5+%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0+%D0%9F%D0%9C%D0%A0+%D0%95%D0%B2%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F+%D0%92%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B0+%D0%A8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%87%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%B0">multiple presidential addresses</a>, and its news reports frequently blamed the parliament for inaction, reassured the public that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Uq-rFbD_u8">pensions and salaries of state-employees will be paid in full in 2017</a>, and tried to cast Shevchuk as the man of the people <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltvEtnUlyVY">against the interests of big business</a> (i.e. suggesting that Krasnoselski would govern in the interests of Sheriff, rather than of the common citizen).

<strong>What to expect?</strong>

<a href="http://wciom.ru/index.php?id=236&amp;uid=115850">Opinion polls</a> published in September gave Krasnoselski a clear lead over Shevchuk and other candidates. The results of the November 2015 parliamentary elections also suggest that Shevchuk’s popularity has declined. Shevchuk has on his side the power of a substantial part of the state apparatus, but Krasnoselski has influence over some key institutions through parliament, is supported by the powerful Sheriff holding and at this stage seems to have better support from Moscow. Overall public dissatisfaction with the economic situation is also likely to play in Krasnoselski’s favour. Given that other candidates are also expected to gather a few percentage points of the vote (Oleg Khorzan, supported by the Communist party, got about 5 per cent at the 2011 elections), a run-off on 25 December cannot be excluded. With or without a run-off, we may be about to witness in Transnistria a new case of an incumbent president who loses at the ballot box and leaves office peacefully: a scenario that is still uncommon in the post-Soviet space, but not unseen in  Transnistria.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/547952">S</a><a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/547952">can </a><a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/547952">I</a><a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/547952">nterfax</a> revealed that in the month of January 2017, for the first time since 2011, Vladimir Putin has not been the most frequently mentioned individual on Russian media: Donald Trump was. The news quickly made the rounds on American media (e.g. on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/02/01/the-only-person-more-popular-in-russian-media-than-putin-trump/?utm_term=.8ee8415ccca8">Washington Post</a>, <a href="http://europe.newsweek.com/trump-putin-most-mentioned-russian-press-media-553661?rm=eu">Newsweek</a>, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/17/politics/russia-trump-relationship-analysis-chance/">CNN</a>, and others).

According to an article by <a href="https://twitter.com/kvoneggert">Konstantin von Eggert</a> <a href="http://www.dw.com/ru/%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BF-%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%8C-%D0%BD%D0%B5-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%88/a-37578453?maca=rus-tco-dw">published by Deutsche Welle</a>, on 15 February Russian state-owned media of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGTRK">VGTRK</a> group were instructed to stop talking about Trump so much. This does not sound unreasonable, as overtly positive coverage of Trump was increasingly at odds with the explicit <a href="http://carnegie.ru/commentary/?fa=60457">anti-americanism that has characterised Russian public discourse in recent years</a>. Yet, how do we know that such instructions have been actually given?<!--more-->

To test if the above statements are accurate, I downloaded all news published on Vesti.Ru (the main state owned all-news channel part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGTRK">VGTRK</a> group) and from Russia’s First Channel (state controlled) for January and February 2017. Separately, I also downloaded the transcripts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Kiselyov">Dmitri Kiselev</a>’s weekly programme for the last 5 years. Kiselev is often characterised as the Kremlin’s chief propagandist, has been included in the EU sanctions list, and has leading positions in the management of Russian state media.

This amounts to a total of 8622 news items from Vesti.ru (all news for January-February 2017, 146 publications a day on average), 3462 news items from Pervy Kanal (all news for January-February 2017, 60 publications a day on average), and all news segments available online of Kiselev’s weekly programme (the archive goes back to June 2011: 3532 news segments in total, including 128 broadcast in January-February 2017)

Here are the results.
<h2>More Trump than Putin? Yes.</h2>
Looking at the first two months of 2017, it appears very clearly that Trump has been mentioned much more frequently than Putin in the selected media in January 2017 by a wide margin (Trump has been mentioned about four times more often than Putin on <em>Vesti</em>). In February 2017, Trump was still more frequently mentioned than Putin on <em>Vesti</em>, but not on <em>Pervy Kanal</em>.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/01-PutinTrumpBarchart_vesti.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74681052 size-large" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/01-PutinTrumpBarchart_vesti-1024x632.png" width="980" height="605" /></a> <a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/02-PutinTrumpBarchart_Pervy.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74681053 size-large" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/02-PutinTrumpBarchart_Pervy-1024x632.png" width="980" height="605" /></a>

Looking at the relevant data for Kiselev's weekly programme, it appears that Trump has been mentioned almost always more often than Putin since before the elections.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TrumpPutinKiselev.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74681055 size-large" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TrumpPutinKiselev-1024x665.png" width="980" height="636" /></a>

In two occasions (post-election and post-inauguration programmes) Trump was mentioned more than 150 times in a programme lasting about 2 hours 15 minutes, i.e. more than once per minute on average.
<h2>Did anybody say "no more Trump"? Maybe.</h2>
If, as suggested by <a href="https://twitter.com/kvoneggert">Konstantin von Eggert</a>, state media were instructed on 15 February to stop talking about Trump, we should expect a steep decrease in the number of references to Trump in the following days.

In the case of <em>Vesti</em>, there does not seem any immediate effect.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TrumpOnlyByDay_vesti.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74681057 size-large" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TrumpOnlyByDay_vesti-1024x1024.png" width="980" height="980" /></a>

Showing the same data based on a 7-days rolling average to highlight trends beyond daily fluctuations, and including mentions of Putin for reference, it appears more clearly that the mentions of Trump are in decline, but it does not seem that 15 February signalled an abrupt change on <em>Vesti.</em>

[A centre-aligned 7-days rolling average in practice means that the data point for each day is actually the average of the data for the given day, and the three days before and after it]

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TrumpPutin7_vesti.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74681058 size-large" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TrumpPutin7_vesti-1024x632.png" width="980" height="605" /></a>

Replicating the same graph with data from  <em>Pervy Kanal </em>presents a rather different picture.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TrumpOnlyByDay_Pervy.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74681059 size-large" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TrumpOnlyByDay_Pervy-1024x1024.png" width="980" height="980" /></a>

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TrumpPutin7_Pervy.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74681060 size-large" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TrumpPutin7_Pervy-1024x632.png" width="980" height="605" /></a>

Not only did the number of 'Trump' mentions start to decrease earlier, but there is also a clearer sign that starting with (approximately) 14 February the number of mentions decreased rather abruptly, and stabilised at much smaller levels, with just very few mentions of Trump (or no mention at all) out of a news coverage composed of about 60 news items per day.

The steep decrease of mentions may well be the result of instructions from above. However, in the context of a broad trend of decreasing attention to Trump, it cannot be excluded that the decrease is "organic".

Finally, looking at Kiselev's weekly programme, it appears that the number of mentions of Trump in the two editions of the programme broadcast after 15 February 2017 is much smaller than in any of the previous programmes of 2017. Again, this is likely the result of  conscious choice, but it is not possible to rule out completely that this is simply related to decreased interest in Trump, once the post-inauguration frenzy has passed.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TrumpOnly_Byprogramme_barchart.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74681062 size-large" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/TrumpOnly_Byprogramme_barchart-1024x1024.png" width="980" height="980" /></a>

It should be highlighted that the high frequency of mentions of Trump over this period is highly unusual: Kiselev barely recorded Obama's re-election, and even at times of international crisis did not mention either Obama or Clinton at comparable levels.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ObamaClintonTrump_LongTermKiselev.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74681064 size-large" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ObamaClintonTrump_LongTermKiselev-1024x1024.png" width="980" height="980" /></a>

This graph highlights the unusual amount of attention that Kiselev's programme dedicated to the American presidential election of 2016, and to Donald Trump in particular.
<h2>To sum up</h2>
This brief analysis confirms that Trump has been mentioned much more frequently than Putin in January 2017 on the main state-controlled media in Russia, and to an extent that seems to be highly unusual, in particular for a foreign head of state.

The data seem to point at a new policy of talking less about Trump effective on <em>Pervy Kanal </em>starting with mid-February. However, a similar trend is not clearly noticeable on <em>Vesti</em>, which is part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGTRK">VGTRK</a> group that allegedly instructed its employees to stop talking about Trump.

While the evidence is not conclusive, this post still presents useful inputs to the debate on the functioning of Russian media. Further analysis, perhaps including sentiment analysis, may allow to see not only how much Russia's media talk about Trump, but also how they talk about him and how media reporting on the American president (or other head of states) impacts on the public perception of a given country.

<h2>Bonus graph on mentions of Ukraine, Crimea and Syria</h2>
As a short update on my 2015 post on "<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/2015/11/03/word-frequency-of-ukraine-crimea-and-syria-on-russias-first-channel/">Word frequency of ‘Ukraine’, ‘Crimea’, and ‘Syria’ on Russia’s First Channel</a>", here is a bonus graph on mentions of Ukraine/Crimea/Syria by Kiselev.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Originally published on<a href="http://presidential-power.com/?p=5796"> Presidential Power</a></em>

The presidential election that took place on 11 December 2016 in Transnistria, a de facto independent state within the internationally recognised borders of Moldova, ended with the resounding victory of the speaker of parliament, Vadim Krasnoselski (62,3%), over the incumbent president, Yevgeny Shevchuk (27,38%), the candidate of the Communist party, Oleg Khorzhan (3,17%), and others (including 3,4% who voted “against all”, which is formally one of the options given on the ballot). <!--more-->According to official data published by the local electoral commission, voter turnout reached 60,1% (corresponding to 252,659 voters), which is higher than both at the 2015 parliamentary election (47%) and at the previous presidential election in 2011 (58,88%). ((An evaluation of voter turnout should take in consideration the fact that a significant share of Transnistria’s population effectively lives and works abroad (<a href="http://kaspy.asu.edu.ru/index.php?articleId=1474">local scholars estimate</a> that migrant workers make up about 20-33% percent of Transnistria’s population), and that it was not possible to vote from outside the territory.))<a href="http://presidential-power.com/?p=5796#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a> There was, thus, no need for a second round, and Krasnoselski officially took office after an inauguration ceremony on 16 December.

The outcome was largely in line with the results of parliamentary elections in 2015 and with expectations on the eve of the vote. Krasnoselski was seen as the favourite thanks to his good connections in Moscow, strong support from Transnistria’s main economic actor (the Sheriff holding), and the economic uncertainty that has characterised Shevchuk’s rule.<a href="http://presidential-power.com/?p=5796#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a> ((See the previous post, <a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/2016/12/08/the-upcoming-presidential-election-in-transnistria/">The upcoming presidential election in Transnistria</a>, for more background information.)) Yet, the incumbent Shevchuk did fight to win the vote until the end, in an increasingly polarised context that at least in part explains the high turnout. Formally, the transition has been smooth so far, with a candidate winning a clear mandate, the electoral commission declaring him the president, and both the incumbent Shevchuk and the first Transnistria president, Igor Smirnov, being present at the <a href="https://youtu.be/WVgKIavz2cc">inauguration ceremony</a>.
<h2>Ensuring a smooth transition</h2>
An <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3169432">article published by the Russian newspaper “Kommersant”</a> highlights the key role of Russian observers in defusing possible tensions, including remaining in contact with both of the main candidates on election day. Two days after the vote, Shevchuk flew to Moscow “invited by the Russian side” – <a href="http://president.gospmr.ru/ru/news/prezident-evgeniy-shevchuk-po-priglasheniyu-rossiyskoy-storony-vyletel-v-moskvu-0">as a concise press release put it</a> – to hold a number of working meetings, where presumably he received instructions about how to ensure a smooth transition and was given reassurances about his own future. ((In spite of accusations of corruption, also the first president of Transnistria Igor Smirnov has never been prosecuted after he has been voted out of office in 2011. He has been able to live in Tiraspol since then and has mostly remained out of public life (until the latest electoral campaign, during which he supported Krasnoselski), living – <a href="http://ru.publika.md/igor-smirnov-zhivet-zhiznyu-pensionera-i-ostorozhno-kommentiruet-sobytiya-na-ukraine_1361501.html">as he put it</a> – the life of a pensioner. It seems likely that at least in the short term the younger Shevchuk will have the chance to spend more time with <a href="https://youtu.be/A_qjSG7x_I4?t=16m18s">his wife Nina Shtanski</a> (former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Transnistria) and <a href="https://youtu.be/A_qjSG7x_I4?t=19m04s">their daughter</a>.)) <a href="http://presidential-power.com/?p=5796#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"></a> On the same day, he signed <a href="http://president.gospmr.ru/ru/news/ukaz-prezidenta-pmr-no-539-o-provedenii-inauguracii-izbrannogo-prezidenta-pridnestrovskoy">a decree</a> anticipating the inauguration ceremony to 16 December (a <a href="http://president.gospmr.ru/ru/news/ukaz-prezidenta-pmr-no-530-o-provedenii-inauguracii-izbrannogo-prezidenta-pridnestrovskoy">decree</a> issued just a few hours earlier scheduled the inauguration on 27 December).

In his first meeting with journalists as president elect, Krasnoselski stated he would not take revenge on those working in the state media and security services who took sides with Shevchuk before the vote.  His words of reassurance should be seen in light of his commitment to keep stability in Transnistria during this period of transition. The fallout from the elections in the state media, the security services and other state institutions remains however to be seen, and in all likelihood there will be significant changes, in particular in senior positions. Immediate dismissals include the director of Transnistria’s public broadcaster, the head of the investigative committee, the republican prosecutor, as well as the head of Transnistria’s national bank. ((The new head of the Transnistrian Republican Bank was until his nomination a senior manager in Sheriff-owned AgropromBank.))<a href="http://presidential-power.com/?p=5796#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"></a> The new configuration of power also implies that Transnistrian residents will have very little chance to hear any criticism of state institutions in the coming years, since both the Sheriff-owned TSV channel and the public broadcaster are due to support Kransoselski and the new government.
<h2>Developments</h2>
Krasnoselski’s victory puts an end to the institutional deadlock between president and parliament that stalled much needed reforms, in particular in relation to the ongoing currency crisis. After ensuring a strong majority in parliament at the 2015 vote, ((The well known connections between Sheriff and current members of parliament have also been recently highlighted by <a href="https://www.rise.md/corporatia-sovietul-suprem-2/">a report by a group of investigative journalists</a>; in fact, 15 out of 43 members of the Transnistrian parliament are currently employed by Sheriff in managerial positions.)) <a href="http://presidential-power.com/?p=5796#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"></a> the interest group around the Sheriff holding can now celebrate the victory of its candidate at the presidential election. In the short term, the renewed harmony between parliament, president, Sheriff, and Moscow is due to open the way for pragmatic solutions to long-standing problems that were hostage of the pre-electoral season. The newly installed government <a href="http://novostipmr.com/ru/news/16-12-17/verhovnyy-sovet-dal-soglasie-na-naznachenie-aleksandra-martynova">led by Aleksandr Martynov</a> comes with a number of initiatives aimed at improving the economic situation in the territory. ((For a closer analysis of the economic issues the new government has to face, see <a href="http://www.lact.ro/2016/12/18/andrey-devyatkov-still-between-scylla-and-charybdis-socio-economic-agenda-of-the-new-transnistrian-government/">Andrey Devyatkov’s analysis on </a><a href="http://www.lact.ro/2016/12/18/andrey-devyatkov-still-between-scylla-and-charybdis-socio-economic-agenda-of-the-new-transnistrian-government/"><em>Lact</em></a> (18 December 2016).)) <a href="http://presidential-power.com/?p=5796#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"></a>But ultimately, Krasnoselski is not coming to power with fundamentally new recipes for enhancing Transnistria’s economy, or with a new foreign policy course.

When Shevchuk was elected five years ago, he was hailed as a reformist and there were even some hopes of an enhanced dialogue with Chişinău. No such hopes come with Krasnoselski. In line with his predecessor, Krasnoselski supports Transnistria’s integration (and eventual unification) with Russia. In spite of the monolithically pro-Russian rhetoric that characterised his campaign, however, he will also have to take a pragmatic stance and take all efforts needed to keep Transnistria’s export routes towards the West open. Limited room for manoeuvre is ultimately a defining characteristic of politics in de facto states, and in the next five years newly elected Krasnoselski will inevitably have to adapt to circumstances and external developments to keep Transnistria afloat.]]></content:encoded>

This is a quick update to the data presented in a previous post published on this blog in November 2015 on "<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/2015/11/03/word-frequency-of-ukraine-crimea-and-syria-on-russias-first-channel/">Word frequency of ‘Ukraine’, ‘Crimea’, and ‘Syria’ on Russia’s First Channel</a>".

The dataset has been created by extracting textual contents of each news item published on Pervy Kanal's website between the beginning of Putin's presidency on 7 May 2012 and 1 March 2017 (115.369 articles in total).<!--more-->

In the graphs, word frequency has been calculated on a centre-aligned rolling average of 30 days in order to highlight trends beyond daily fluctuations that would make the graph difficult to read; in practice, this means that the data point for each day effectively corresponds to the average of the 30 days around it (more specifically, the day itself, the 14 days preceding it, and the 15 days following it).

Word frequencies have been calculated including all variations of a given term. For example, the value for the frequency of "Ukraine" in practice corresponds to all mentions of *ukrain* - in order to include all forms and declensions of Ukraine in Russian, as well as expressions such as "antiukrainian". Filters have however been checked manually in order to remove false flags, e.g. to make sure that Greek party "Syriza" is not counted as "Syria".

The graphs are presented here without further analysis.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Is being famous nationally an asset or a liability for candidates competing in a single-constituency electoral system in a small polity? Judging from the recent elections in Abkhazia, certainly not a big asset, and probably a liability, in particular in the second round.

In this post, "being famous" is operationalised as "number of mentions of given candidate" in Abkhazia's main news agency. Relevant data are presented in a few graphs below. While only those familiar with political figures in Abkhazia will recognise the names, colour schemes should make this post intelligible also to readers interested in the general question, rather than to election dynamics in this specific case.<!--more-->
<h2>March 2017 parliamentary elections in Abkhazia</h2>
On 12 and 26 March 2017, two rounds of parliamentary elections have been held in Abkhazia. As all political processes taking place in de facto states, they are considered illegitimate by the international community, with few exceptions. They also cannot claim to be fully democratic, as they are based on the structural exclusion of Georgian residents who were forced to leave their homes during the conflict in the early 1990s, as well as those Georgians that remained or returned to the territory. Only 603 residents were included in the electoral lists of the Gali district out of a population that, according to Abkhazia's own statistical office, amounts to 30.247 as of 1 January 2016. Even besides the structural exclusion of Georgians, the relative marginalisation of Armenians (and Russians) who live in the territory brings Abkhazia closer to the model of "ethnic democracy" (Kolstø and Blakkisrud 2013).

In spite of thes limitations, elections in Abkhazia have proven to be highly competitive. As highlighted by Ó Beacháin (2012; 2016), most incumbents decide to contest elections, but only few of them succeed in doing so. In 2007, out of 26 incumbents contesting the election, only 10 won. In 2012, out of 21, only 5 were re-relected. In 2017, this trend has been confirmed, with <a href="http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=29968">8 incumbents being re-elected out of 28 contesting the election</a>.

Another trend that has emerged clearly from the recent vote is that of very well known public figures failing to be re-elected. For example, Sergey Shamba (former prime-minister, long-standing minister of foreign affairs, and head of the party "United Abkhazia"),  lost in the first round to a doctor with no political experience and a sportsman. But also former foreign minister Vyacheslav Chirikba, as well as other well known public figures, lost in the first round.

Are these isolated cases, or do really well known public figures have no better chances of being (re-)elected than other candidates who are, comparatively speaking, local unknowns?
<h2>Famous candidates</h2>
In order to test this hypothesis, I have extracted the full names of all candidates who were registered for the elections, as issued by Abkhazia's central electoral commission and published by <a href="http://www.apsnypress.info/cik/">Apsnypress </a>for a total of 142 registered candidates, only a few them with formal party affiliation.

I then extracted all the news available on Abkhazia's news agency Apsnypress between January 2010 and the day before the elections, for a total of 17.509 news items.

Finally, I counted how many times the combination "name surname" of each of the candidates appeared in the news (accounting for the fact names may be declined in Russian).

This is the result:

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/all-candidates-bn.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74681408" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/all-candidates-bn-546x1024.png" alt="" width="546" height="1024" /></a>

Unsurprisingly, There is a huge difference among candidates, with former president Aleksander Ankvab being mentioned much more frequently than any other candidate. It is worth noticing that a large share of candidates has never or almost never been mentioned on Apsnypress.

In order to enhance readability, the following graph excludes Ankvab and those candidates mentioned less than 50 times.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/candidatesnoAnkvabnoLess50-bn.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74681410" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/candidatesnoAnkvabnoLess50-bn-1024x731.png" alt="" width="980" height="700" /></a>Readers familiar with Abkhazia's politics will find, as expected, many familiar names in this graph. Indeed, while not without its shortcomings, it seems that frequency of mentions on Apsnypress may serve as useful proxy to rank how famous a public figure is in Abkhazia.

The following graphs introduce elections results: dark green is for those elected at the first round, light green for those elected at the second round, light orange for those who lost at the second round, red for those who lost at the first round. In one district, where former prime minister Lakerbaia was running, the vote will be repeated on 14 of May after a contestation.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mostfamous_coloured.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74681411" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mostfamous_coloured-546x1024.png" alt="" width="546" height="1024" /></a>Below, same graph as above, excluding the top-5 most famous, to allow for some more details for those mentioned less frequently.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mostfamous_coloured_notTop5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74681412" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mostfamous_coloured_notTop5-546x1024.png" alt="" width="546" height="1024" /></a>

Excluding former prime minister Lakerbaia (elections will be repeated in the district where he was a candidate), 3 out of the top 10 got elected. This is better than average, in particular if Lakerbaia will eventually be elected (on average, there were about 5 candidates for every seat), but not impressively so. It should also be highlighted that about half of newly elected members of parliament have never or only very rarely made the news (i.e. appeared in any form on ApsnyPress in the last seven years).

In the following graph, the data are shown grouped by district. Each district is given the same space in the graph, so thicker bars means less candidates in a given district. Ankvab (who won district 18) has been removed from the graph, otherwise his very high number of mentions would have effectively hidden all other results.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/allByDistrictByOutcome.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74681414" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/allByDistrictByOutcome-341x1024.png" alt="" width="560" height="1680" /></a>

Finally, the next graph shows the results only for those districts that reached the second round.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/secondRoundByDistrictByOutcome.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74681415" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/secondRoundByDistrictByOutcome-683x1024.png" alt="" width="683" height="1024" /></a>

Again, it does not seem that being "famous" gives a clear advantage. On the contrary, in only 7 out of the 22 districts that went to a second round the most "famous" candidate was elected.
<h2>By way of conclusion</h2>
In a majoritarian system such as the one used for parliamentary elections in Abkhazia, national fame may not really matter, since only voters in the relevant district have a say on the outcome. In a small polity such as Abkhazia, candidates need only about 1.000 votes from their district to be elected in the first round (all those who have been elected in the first round received between 927 and 1.745 votes, and mostly just above 1.000 votes). Local or even family dynamics may be dominant.

Is this a feature common to other small polities? Does this happen in some larger countries as well? I admit I am not familiar with the relevant literature, and a quick search on Google Scholar did not prompt relevant results.

Specifically in the case of Abkhazia, other aspects that may interact with "fame", include ethnicity, being incumbent or not, having a known Abkhaz surname, being a candidate for a party, being a candidate in a rural or city district, and gender. Verifying related hypotheses, however, goes well beyond the scope of this post.

A few weeks ago, out of curiosity, <a href="https://twitter.com/DavideDenti">Davide Denti</a> asked me if I knew how to parse OpenStreetMap data in order to find all streets and squares dedicated to Tito in the former Yugoslavia. I was unfamiliar with how OpenStreetMap stores data, but after a few quick attempts I managed to extract some data and produce a map that looked meaningful. Early feedback suggested that the data were incomplete, and I did not fully polish the data, but - aware that I would not have the time to work on this in the following weeks, and perhaps I would never pick it up again - I decided to make public <a href="https://giocomai.github.io/TitoOnTheMap/">the draft document I created</a>. I included a notice highlighting that the document was in draft form, that it was only based on OpenStreetMap data, that the data have not been revised and may include substantial inaccuracies. I also made clear that I welcomed suggestions on how to improve it.

Having done this, I thought it was fine to share the result on Twitter.<!--more-->

The material gathered a lot of attention from the Balkan Twittersphere, and was soon picked up by local media (including Sarajevo's <a href="http://ba.n1info.com/a176213/Vijesti/Vijesti/Titove-ulice-u-BiH.html">TV N1</a>), a number of news websites (such as <a href="https://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/clanak/karta-ovo-su-sve-ulice-i-trgovi-u-bivsoj-jugoslaviji-koji-i-dalje-nose-titovo-ime-20170726">Tportal.hr</a>, <a href="http://telegrafi.com/per-dallim-prej-kosoves-vendet-e-ish-jugosllavise-kane-ende-rruge-emrin-e-titos/">Telegrafi.com</a>, <a href="http://tvsa.ba/titove-ulice-hrvatska-i-makedonija-ih-imaju-najvie-bih-na-treem-mj-p7668-178.htm">tvsa.ba</a>, <a href="https://www.klix.ba/magazin/zanimljivosti/titove-ulice-hrvatska-i-makedonija-ih-imaju-najvise-bih-na-trecem-mjestu/170724106">klix.ba</a>), as well as a thematic website such as <a href="http://www.titomanija.com.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1284&amp;Itemid=1">Titomanija</a>.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In the lapse of a few weeks, a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U7EqM2XDLHpyjJaEBy3inOETYg4&amp;usp=sharing">map on Google Maps with a layer showing Tito's streets</a> that I linked in the document (but not in the tweet or most mentions by other websites) gathered more than 30.000 views. It is safe to say that many more saw the data as they have been posted on social media and elsewhere online.

As I started to revise the data, and did some testing through the Google Maps API, I became increasingly aware that - as we suspected from the beginning - OpenStreetMap data were far from complete, and actually included only less than half of all streets dedicated to Tito that could be found on Google Maps. Even worse, the data were <em>unevenly</em> incomplete, and as a result they gave a wrong impression on which areas had a higher density of streets dedicated to Tito.  The fact that OpenStreetMap misses a lot of street names in Vojvodina - which proved to be the region with most streets dedicated to Tito - had a particularly substantial impact.
<h2>~40.000 queries to Google Maps later</h2>
I decided to spend a bit more time on this, and wrote a script that queried Google Maps for Tito streets in all inhabited locations of the former Yugoslavia (excluding villages that according to OpenStreetMap categorisation had less than 1.000 residents).

The much more complete results (which, again, have not yet been thoroughly revised, and show some small inconsistencies with OpenStreetMap data) are <a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/FindingTito/">now available at this link </a>- <a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/FindingTito/summary-of-results.html">click here to skip directly to the summary and relative maps</a>.
<h2>Transparency and openness</h2>
At first, I had mixed feelings about the fact that a draft map with incomplete and (as it turned out) partially misleading results got so much attention. Actually, I still have.

On the other hand, data analysis is an iterative, bumpy, and time-consuming process. In the age of social media, isn't it fair to share work-in-progress as it evolves? Feedback, alternative sources, better approaches, new ideas, or more efficient code may be around the corner. Besides, making the whole process as transparent as possible, including by sharing the code and making it public under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">permissive Creative Commons license</a> has many benefits. One of them, is that it enables replication, and allows others to develop further this project in new directions. It also enables conducting a similar research in a different context (e.g. a different country, a different street name) by simply changing a few lines of code.

In spite of their contested nature, de facto states in the post-Soviet space engage in substantive external relations across a number of sectors, well beyond the dominant relationship they have with their patron. In recent years, confidence building programmes sponsored by the European Union have represented a venue for interactions between local actors in de facto states and the outside world. Such assistance – including capacity building projects and relatively small initiatives aimed at enhancing the social infrastructure in the health and education sector – contributes to the welfare of the local population and is welcomed by de facto authorities. However, for the most part, it is not conducive to more confidence between de facto authorities and parent state, or between local societies and the European Union. This is partly due to the context of the conflicts and contrasting long-term perspectives, but – as will be argued – is also consequence of the way in which these initiatives are framed. Changing the framing of at least some of these initiatives may be a small but meaningful step towards building a more enabling environment around these territories.<!--more-->
<h2>What confidence building is understood to mean in de facto states</h2>
In both Transnistria and Abkhazia, confidence building is broadly understood as part of the efforts by the international community and the parent state to achieve territorial reintegration. This is largely due to the fact that most external actors have been unequivocal in their support for territorial integrity of the parent state, routinely issuing statements to this effect. There is nothing in the public statements issued by actors such as the European Union that would suggest that they are open about the final status of these entities: territorial integrity of the parent state is unequivocally proposed as the only option they support.

This is a political decision, broadly shared by all EU member states, and there is no reason to believe that this position is going to change any time soon. From the analytical point of view, this can be understood as a fixed point. One of the consequences, is that – as long as it explicitly supports one of the sides – the European Union cannot possibly be seen as a neutral broker in conflict negotiations. Yet, even in this context, the EU is not perceived in de facto states as an inherently hostile actor. In both Abkhazia and Transnistria, authorities are ready and willing to maintain a degree of dialogue with the EU. Beyond official venues for conflict negotiations (5+2 OSCE-led format in the case of Transnistria, Geneva meetings in the case of Abkhazia), authorities in de facto states find themselves interacting with various manifestations of the European Union. For example, they have a direct line of contact with EU-sponsored missions that – albeit in a very different format – patrol their borders: the ‘EU Border Assistance Mission’ (EUBAM) in the case of Transnistria, and the more explicitly conflict-related ‘EU monitoring mission’ (EUMM) in the case of Abkhazia.

De facto authorities also see the EU as a donor, that either directly or through implementing agencies such as UNDP runs programmes aimed at residents of these territories, as well as NGOs based there. Confidence building programmes represent the “umbrella” under which an important part of these initiatives have been taking place for a few years. For example, the programme “<a href="http://www.md.undp.org/content/moldova/en/home/operations/projects/inclusive_growth/confidence-building-measures-programme-1.html">Support to Confidence Building Measures Programme</a>” has been established by the EU in 2009 to approach the conflict in Transnistria, and is currently running its fourth iteration. COBERM (<a href="http://coberm.net/en/">Confidence Building Early Response Mechanism</a>) has been set-up by the EU in 2010 to address conflicts in Georgia, and is currently running through its third iteration, COBERM-3. Both initiatives have a relatively small total budget (between one and four million euro per year); COBERM in particular sponsors mostly small, short term projects, aimed at increasing dialogue among communities.

However, among the various ongoing initiatives sponsored by external governmental and non-governmental actors, it is exactly confidence building programmes that raise most suspicion in de facto authorities. In an interview with this author, a representative of de facto authorities in Sukhumi suggested that at some point they may openly request for such initiatives to be interrupted, as sometimes they feel like people have been using their conflict, suffering, and history to – effectively – earn some money and make tours. Beyond that, quite simply, confidence building initiatives of this kind do not contribute to the goals of the de facto leadership.
<h2>Confidence building, sweeter by any other name?</h2>
Some of the projects financed under these programmes indeed focus specifically on peace-building initiatives, mostly address civil society actors, and should continue along current lines. In many cases, however, acknowledging that straightforward confidence building initiatives may not be viable or fruitful in these contexts, local officers pragmatically decline confidence building measures as  – effectively – capacity building projects or traditional development assistance. It is argued here that this approach should not only be welcomed, but also strengthened and institutionalised, since framing capacity building initiatives as confidence building contributes to defeat their nominal purpose, and hinders their implementation.

This is due to the fact that authorities and individuals in de facto states often look suspiciously at such interventions, assuming that their final goal is territorial reintegration with the parent state, rather than their welfare. This state of affairs leads to a paradoxical situation. If similar programmes were labelled as development assistance or capacity building, they would likely be received more warmly by local authorities and residents alike, thus increasing confidence of local societies towards international organisations and perhaps even the parent state. On the contrary, the label of ‘confidence building’ politicises what could otherwise be welcomed as humanitarian or development assistance; as things stand, de facto states remain understandably suspicious of the motivations behind these initiatives, and disapprove of the seemingly unaltruistic nature of assistance.
<h2>Surpassing the triple bottleneck of assistance to de facto states</h2>
The framing and substance of external assistance to de facto states (beyond that received from their patron) is the result of a triple bottleneck: assistance must be acceptable for de facto authorities, for the central government in the parent state, and must focus on aspects that international donors are willing to fund. “Confidence building in form, capacity building in content” is one of the formula that made it possible for continued operation of international programmes in Transnistria and Abkhazia. It is less than ideal, but it has served its purpose.

The parent states appreciate the framing of confidence building, as they feel such efforts contribute to their declared goal of territorial reintegration. As long as the contents are not exclusively focused on the conflict dimension, de facto authorities see the benefits of programmes that in some circumstances complement assistance they receive from the patron. Finally, maintaining the label of confidence building allows donors such as the European Union to implement meaningful projects while leaving out of the question the issue of conditionality, that would anyway be effectively impossible to apply in the context of de facto states that receive considerable assistance from a patron that exerts different (and mostly implicit) conditionality.

However, as has been argued, the current setting is less than ideal: it contributes in some form to the welfare of local residents, it maintains a channel of communication open, but it is hardly conducive to increased confidence between key actors. Besides, this framing discourages local actors from taking ownership of EU-sponsored initiatives and programmes. Is there a way to enlarge the bottleneck, i.e. to ensure that activities are acceptable to all actors involved, while creating the space to implement projects in a context that encourages ownership of relevant initiatives by local stakeholders and is at the same time conducive to actual confidence building? Changing the framing of some initiatives currently being sponsored within confidence building programmes would be a small step, but one in the right direction.
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
Of course, the approach outlined above is not new, and indeed, in the context of post-Soviet de facto states there are a number of initiatives sponsored by the European Union and other donors that do not employ the language of confidence building. For example, the EU is currently implementing in Abkhazia a 4 million USD programme on rural development (the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/eni_2015_c2015_7148_annual_action_programme_for_georgia_enpard_ii.pdf">ENPARD II</a> programme – European Neighbourhood Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development) which is no way related to confidence building mechanisms. Fundamentally, the reasoning proposed here should not be construed as suggesting a decrease in the already limited resources dedicated to confidence building, which is certainly not a sector that has been funded with particular generosity. Quite on the contrary, in the case of Georgia, even within the EU budget dedicated to issues related to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, much more EU resources are invested in the EU monitoring mission (with <a href="https://eumm.eu/en/about_eumm/facts_and_figures">a yearly budget of 18,3 million Euro</a> as of 2017) than in confidence building programmes such as Coberm (<a href="http://coberm.net/en/about-coberm/About">Coberm II had 5 million euro budget in total for three years</a>), or other forms of assistance targeting residents in these territories.

To summarise, it is argued that shifting the framing of assistance (as well as resources) away from conflict-related terminology and initiatives and towards labels and practices such as ‘inclusive capacity development’ or ‘inclusive growth’ (which is already mentioned as the single ‘focus area’ of the <a href="http://www.md.undp.org/content/moldova/en/home/operations/projects/inclusive_growth/confidence-building-measures-programme-1.html">ongoing EU/UNDP confidence building programme related to Transnistria</a>) may bring positive externalities, including an enabling environment that would be more conducive to trust and confidence among stakeholders and local societies. While geopolitical context and realities on the field make it difficult to imagine a radical change in perceptions in the foreseeable future, such an approach would contribute to build a positive image of the European Union and other external actors involved, and send the message that other external actors – besides the patron – are willing to commit themselves to enhance the welfare and livelihood of local residents in post-Soviet de facto states.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My PhD thesis - <a href="http://doras.dcu.ie/22159/"><em>What is the effect of non-recognition? The external relations of de facto states in the post-Soviet space</em></a> - is now online and can be downloaded freely.

Aware of the limited allure of a 300-pages pdf file, I decided to outline here some key outcomes (not necessarily the conclusions), as well as some additional thoughts.<!--more-->
<h2>1. Non-recognition is the symptom, not the cause</h2>
<p class="western">First, a one-paragraph summary of my conclusions. Once post-Soviet de facto states are conceptualised as small, dependent, and partly isolated jurisdictions, many seemingly unusual features of their external relations can be explained without reference to lack of recognition. Indeed, prevalent dynamics of external relations found in these territories, such as strong dependence on a patron, are compatible with those found in uncontested territories on both sides of the sovereignty divide. Most features of external relations described in different parts of my research can be related to underlying dynamics, rather than - strictly speaking - lack of recognition. Ultimately, non-recognition is a symptom rather than the cause of the complex environment that surrounds these entities and determines the boundaries of their external relations.</p>
I developed this argument further in an article published on <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17449057.2017.1393210"><em>Ethnopolitics</em></a>, where I introduce a comparison with nominally sovereign Pacific island states such as the Marshall Islands and Palau. Another, closer set of terms of comparison (that is not really discussed in the paper, and only briefly outlined in the thesis) it that of sub-state entities in the Russian federation. Along the key set of indicators I refer to in my research (migration, remittances, aid, and bureaucracy - i.e. a high share of civil servants), republics in the Northern Caucasus apparently present remarkably similarities with post-Soviet de facto states. The fact that а significant part of budget expenditure in Abkhazia and South Ossetia is determined jointly by the local authorities in Sukhumi and Tskhinvali, and the Russian Ministry for North Caucasus affairs is also telling. ((It is worth highlighting that joint negotiation of budget expenditure is common in nominally sovereign small dependent jurisdictions, as well as in sub-state entities with meaningful self-government.))

The comparison between post-Soviet de facto states and Pacific islands is one based on similarities among jurisdictions that are strikingly different in most respect. A structured comparison that is on the contrary focused on differences, aimed at analysing the political economy (or political competition, or decision-making processes) of post-Soviet de facto states and republics in Russia's northern Caucasus may be particularly helpful in understanding what is peculiar about the functioning of these entities, and singling out other aspects that, after all, are heavily influenced by non-recognition (or perhaps, by not being fully incorporated into the patron). Thinking of potential new venues for research, this is certainly one.
<h2>2. How much does Russia spend there? Is it affordable?</h2>
In my dissertation, I approach the question "<em>Where does the money come from?</em>", and I detail how most of the budget and the pension system of these jurisdictions is financed by their patron. In the relevant chapter, I include also a number of graphs that present data on how much money is involved, and puts these relatively high figures in context (I have posted some of the graphs on Twitter with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/giocomai/status/860453939065610246">#deFactoStats</a>, and I plan to release them in the form of a structured dataset.)

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

To cover for all direct expenses such as pensions payments  and budget assistance to Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia, Russia currently spends significantly less than 1 billion USD a year. It was probably close to 1 billion USD in 2013 - excluding military expenditure - but due to the fall of the exchange rates as well as other priorities (such as Crimea and the war in Ukraine) it decreased substantially if calculated in USD in the following years. Is this a lot? For the recipients, it certainly is, both as a share of budget, and per capita (according to my estimates, South Ossetia would likely top the world ranking of jurisdictions by aid per capita in most years). But for a country with an economy such as Russia's, not really. Even after the economic crisis and the fall of the exchange rate in late 2014, as of 2016, Russia's GDP stood at about 1283 billion USD (<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=RU">Source: World Bank</a>). As of 2016, Russia's central budget expenditure stood at 232 billions (<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.CON.GOVT.CD?locations=RU">Source: World Bank</a>). ((If the exchange rate remains stable at 2017 levels, the <a href="http://tass.ru/info/4679765">planned budget expenditure for 2018</a> would however be significantly higher, or about 283 billion USD)) From these figures, it appears that less than 0,3% of Russia's budget expenditure goes to sponsor Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. This is significant, but probably affordable in the long term as long as there is some political capital associated with these territories.
<h2>3. What kind of external assistance reaches these territories?</h2>
In the thesis, I detail some of the ways in which different international actors provide assistance for state and capacity building. Again, unsurprisingly, the patron is the most important source of assistance in developing local capacities. Indeed, even beyond direct financial transfers, authorities in these territories receive from their patron multi-faceted capacity-building assistance in quite literally all sectors of state activity. The pervasiveness of such interactions (and the ensuing alignment of practices) became increasingly apparent as I advanced with my research.

Non-patron assistance is focused on fewer sectors and to some extent is complementary to Russian assistance. The label of "confidence building" covers a significant part of it, even when assistance is not strictly conflict-related. I have argued in a separate post ("<a href="http://postsoviet.eu/2017/06/01/confidence-building-by-any-other-name-surpassing-the-triple-bottleneck-of-assistance-to-de-facto-states/">Confidence building, by any other name? Surpassing the triple bottleneck of assistance to de facto states</a>") that a different framing may bring positive externalities. Indeed, this is already happening to some extent, and I believe this is a trend that should be fully embraced by forward-looking international donors.
<h2>4. There's a lot of evidence online, and often Google won't help</h2>
In a recent article based on my PhD research, I have outlined some examples of “<a href="http://publications.tlu.ee/index.php/stss/article/view/346/446">Quantitative Analysis of Web Content in Support of Qualitative Research</a>". I don't want to dismiss the "quantitative" part, but I really think my main argument is about "structured analysis of web contents." There's plenty of evidence to be found in online sources, official websites, local media, etc.

Parsing these contents in a systematic way can be more effective, and often quicker than alternative approaches. ((Of course, it needs then to be complemented by other approaches, most prominently, interviews and fieldwork.)) A structured approach also makes it possible to subset and reduce even hundreds of thousands of news items or press releases to a manageable number that can be parsed manually to find additional data points or information.

I feel that many colleagues and area studies experts find the technicalities involved off-putting. This is understandable, but regrettable. My hope is that, in due time, an ecosystem will grow whereby it will be easier to conduct structured analysis of online contents, as well as to outline how we conduct our research in a way that can be easily accessed and directly scrutinised by fellow researchers. I think we all have to gain by increasing the transparency of what has by now become a considerable part of many research projects, yet remains hidden in most research outputs: looking up stuff online.

I suppose (I hope?) that some larger organisation will take up the effort to develop the necessary infrastructure. In the meantime, <a href="https://github.com/giocomai/castarter">I have started developing a package for the R programming language</a> that facilitates all of the above: it allows to transform online sources in textual datasets, and allows to share the results in an interface that can easily be used without requiring specific training. <a href="https://giocomai.shinyapps.io/Kremlin_en/">Here's interactive example based on press releases issued by the Kremlin</a>, here's <a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/2017/03/20/word-frequency-of-ukraine-crimea-dnrlnr-and-novorossiya-on-1tv-ru/">a post outlining a potential output on Russian media</a>, and here's <a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/2017/03/31/abkhazias-parliamentary-elections-not-for-the-famous/">another one focused on elections in Abkhazia</a>; these examples are all based on word frequency, but again, I believe that the "systematic" rather than the "quantitative" component is what really matters.

As, quite clearly, software development is not my main occupation, this package is functional, but still rough. In due time, I will hopefully be able to add introduce new functionalities, and enable the creation of textual datasets from arbitrary websites directly from a visual interface that expects very little technical competence from the user.
<h2>5. Concluding thoughts</h2>
Unsurprisingly, I am not completely satisfied with my dissertation, and I already look rather critically at some of its parts. With a smile, I blame all shortcomings to my becoming a parent in the early stages of this research. More seriously, I believe that becoming a parent has fundamentally changed my approach to research. Among other things, it led to less fieldwork, probably less readings, and of course less sleeping, but it also gave me unusually lengthy stretches of time for thinking freely, which I think had a positive impact on my research.

Again, the thesis is available in its full glory, with pictures and plenty of coloured graphs <a href="http://doras.dcu.ie/22159/">from this link</a>. Overall, I do believe it represents an original contribution to the literature on post-Soviet de facto states, theoretically, empirically, and methodologically.

I must take this chance to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/DonnachaDCU">Donnacha Ó Beacháin</a> for accompanying me through this journey as my supervisor, as a fellow researcher with insatiable curiosity, and as a friend. <a href="https://twitter.com/Toal_CritGeo">Gerard Toal</a>, for pushing me to think further and harder about many aspects of my research as my external examiner. <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnDoyleDCU">John Doyle</a> for ensuring a positive and friendly research environment through my stay at Dublin City University. And so many other fellow researchers I have met through these years.

The PhD journey is never easy. Which is why it is not without some genuine surprise that I find myself typing the final words of this post: it's been a joy.]]></content:encoded>

<em>This is a brief excerpt from the thesis. For more details about my research, see also the post "<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/2018/04/08/non-recognition-is-the-symptom-not-the-cause/">Non-recognition is the symptom, not the cause</a>".
</em><!--more-->

The object of research, as well as the methodological approach used to study it, are often determined by personal experience. Indeed, this study is the result of long-held interest towards these territories, that at least in part may stem from my own origins in Trentino-Alto Adige/South Tyrol, a pacific and relatively wealthy border region with a contested past that is now part of Italy. Dominant local narratives depict Trentino-Alto Adige/South Tyrol as a clear success story: extensive autonomy agreements are credited with having prevented conflict and limited tensions among various ethno-linguistic groups of residents. A treaty-based autonomy agreement that gives highly formalised rights and guarantees to different ethno-linguistic groups has been the received wisdom and commonsensical solution to potential ethno-territorial conflicts I inherited from my early education. As a young student, the fact that autonomy did not always work and in some instances may have even been a factor leading to conflict was in itself puzzling. Even the view I had from my childhood’s home in the southern Alps mattered: as I started reading about war and ethnic cleansing in post-Soviet mountain territories, accustomed to see a valley scattered with villages from a privileged mountainside position, I could visually picture too well the human suffering related to these conflicts and the pain of being forced to leave one’s family’s ancestral home.

I started studying Russian by chance in high school in the late 1990s, and since year 2000 I regularly visited for lengthy periods Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. As a graduate student based at RGGU in Moscow in 2005, I wrote (in Russian) for a course on conflict studies my first paper on the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict: while not technically “pre-internet”, that paper was largely based on materials I found in the local library. It was not until 2009 that I first visited Transnistria, and until 2010 when I first visited Abkhazia. As a researcher and editor at <em>Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso</em>, when visiting the region, I was combining research with journalism. For example, while working on a book chapter eventually published in 2013 under the title “<a href="https://www.academia.edu/6598912/Sovereignty_conflicts_and_minority_protection_the_case_of_Abkhazia">Sovereignty Conflicts and Minority Protection: the Case of Abkhazia</a>”, I also produced <a href="https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Abkhazia/In-Abkhazia-worried-about-the-language-law-124824">lengthy feature stories</a> and published <a href="https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Abkhazia/Abkhazia-s-Armenians-multilingualism-is-the-future-106982">edited interviews with key respondents</a>. At the time, my approach to research was largely based on fieldwork and left little room for theorising: a research project on youth policies in Russia and the northern Caucasus I was conducting at the time resulted in <a href="http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/aeer/article/view/1997">an article published by Anthropology of East Europe Review</a> that was based almost exclusively on ethnographic observations and featured pictures from my visits to pro-government youth camps in Russia’s northern Caucasus. Another journal rejected a previous version of the same article exactly because it was too much focused on direct observation, and did not include a substantive theoretical section.

Work on the present study, which I started in 2013, has been heavily influenced by previous experience. On the one hand, I wished to continue and expand my research on post-Soviet de facto states. On the other, I desired to take it as a chance for marking a change with the way I previously did research: a four-year research project would have given me the chance to spend more time reading, theorising, and reflecting more on methodological aspects. As I moved to Ireland to start my studies at Dublin City University, I became increasingly aware of different epistemological and methodological debates, as well as the high importance given to issues such as replicability in important parts of the scholarly community that surrounded me.

This experience strengthened my desire to develop this research in a way that would be a clear break from my previous research, and would make it acceptable, or at least defensible, in front of scholars coming from different academic traditions. As a consequence, I aimed at developing a research with a substantive and ambitious theoretical component, and where fieldwork and evidence gathered through unstructured interviews would be complemented by other fully formalised and replicable data collection methods. Last but not least, my becoming a parent in the early stages of this research endeavour pushed me to reduce the time I initially envisioned for lengthy periods of fieldwork, further reinforcing the feeling that I should give more prominence to theory and fully formalised and replicable data collection methods.

The information I gathered during fieldwork for this project, as well as during my previous visits to these territories, has been fundamental in developing my overall thinking on these places, in shaping the research design, as well as in providing insights on specific aspects to an extent that likely does not fully emerge from the following chapters. This is partly because whenever an information I obtained through interviews was equally available in an online source, I consciously chose to refer to the online source rather than my personal interview, in line with the principle of replicability as well as out of ethical considerations (as will be discussed, even representatives of major international organisations find themselves in a relatively fragile situation in the context of post-Soviet de facto states).

<em>We have analysed Transnistrian online media 18 months after Vadim Krasnoselski came to power. We found clear evidence of selective removal of “unpleasant” old news items, but no evidence of mass dismissal of journalists.</em> <!--more-->

In Transnistria - a de facto independent state located within the internationally recognised borders of Moldova - in the aftermath of the December 2016 presidential vote, the risk of increased tensions seemed to be particularly high, as Vadim Krasnoselski - who won the vote - had threatened to jail the incumbent Shevchuk <a title="Link a on live TV during a pre-electoral debate" href="https://youtu.be/V_HC6UOEzjk?t=10m16s">on live TV during a pre-electoral debate</a>, and people in top positions close to Shevchuk knew they had a lot to lose from an unfavourable electoral outcome. The transition, however, has been managed peacefully - at least in part, under the careful watch of Moscow - in order to avert a major crisis.

If in exchange for leaving their positions of power peacefully Shevchuk and other members of his close circle had been given some reassurance about their safety, the deal has not hold. Shevchuk himself had to flee to Chișinău fearing prosecution in Tiraspol, and a number of high-ranking officials under his tenure (including former interior minister, former head of the customs committee, and the former head of the republican bank) <a title="Link a have been jailed" href="https://tv.pgtrk.ru/ru/news/20170929/61775">have been jailed</a>. Apparently, <a title="Link a many others left for Odessa" href="http://mk.kn.md/articles/2017/02/23/eksglava-kgb-pridnestrovya-pokhishhen-neizvestnymi.html">many others left for Odessa</a>. Lower ranking officials probably mostly kept their place. But what about journalists at the state-owned broadcaster <em>Pervy Pridnestrovski</em>? The TV channel has been a central element of the pre-electoral struggle, with news reporting explicitly promoting the line of then-president Shvechuk, blaming the opposition led by (as it turned out, soon-to-become president) Vadim Krasnoselski for the ongoing economic crisis, and casting doubts about the motivations and interests of the presidential contender Krasnoselski and his backers at the powerful <em>Sheriff</em> holding.

Soon after the vote, <em>Pervy Pridnestrovski</em> started characterising as criminal the very same policies that they presented in a positive light until recently, and duly reported about investigations against high-ranking officials of the previous government. In his first meeting with journalists as president elect, <a title="Link a Krasnoselski stated he would not take revenge" href="http://presidential-power.com/?cat=1046">Krasnoselski stated he would not take revenge</a> on those working in the state media and security services who took sides with Shevchuk before the vote. Yet, the old management of the TV channel was removed <a title="Link a already before Krasnoselski’s inauguration" href="http://newsmaker.md/rus/novosti/smi-pod-kontrolem-novaya-vlast-v-pridnestrove-nachala-kadrovye-perestanovki-28874">already before Krasnoselski’s inauguration</a>, and <a title="Link a allegedely" href="https://alfa24.online/2017/07/15/ne-teh-laikaes-uvolnaisa-zurnalisty">allegedely</a> a number of journalists left Transnistria in the aftermath of the vote.

Eventually, what happened? Did journalists in state-owned media stay or did they go? And did the new leadership of state-owned media remove news items published during the harsh presidential campaign?
<h3>Deleting old news</h3>
These questions can be approached by systematically parsing the websites of relevant news outlets before and after the vote. Unfortunately, I did not previously scrape the website of <em>Pervy Pridnestrovski</em>. However, just a few weeks before the elections, I did scrape the YouTube channel of the TV station <a title="Link a for a different article" href="http://presidential-power.com/?p=5667">for a different article</a>. The <a title="Link a table available at this link" href="https://github.com/giocomai/transnistria_media_post_election_2018/blob/master/PervyPridnestrovskiRemovedYT.csv">table available at this link</a> lists all YouTube videos that were on <em>Pervy Pridnestrovski</em>’s YouTube channel on 25 November 2016 (two weeks before the vote), but were not on-line as of this writing in late May 2018. It seems highly likely that the vast majority of the 27 clips thus identified have been removed for political reasons, as they mostly focus on activities by Krasnoselski and his backers from the business group <em>Sheriff</em> that were either allegedly criminal or otherwise characterised as highly damaging for Transnistria.

The pages corresponding to these video clips have also been removed from the official website of the TV channel, yet evidence of the existence of these materials persists on-line: a privately owned website that mirrors <em>Pervy Pridnestrovski</em>’s contents still has all the correspondent pages (<a title="Link a example link" href="http://novostipmr.ru/video/1tv/2016-06-majoneznaya-panika/">example link</a>), while many of the video clips themselves are available on the Russia-based social network <em>Odnoklassniki</em> (<a title="Link a example link" href="https://m.ok.ru/video/11387667741">example link</a>) or elsewhere on the Internet.
<h3>Did the same happen with news agency Novosti Pridnestrov’ia?</h3>
<em>Novosti Pridnestrov’ia</em> - <a title="Link a https://novostipmr.com/" href="https://novostipmr.com/">https://novostipmr.com/</a> - is a Tiraspol-based news agency owned by the local authorities. Did they also selectively remove news items that are in contrast with the narrative presented by the new authorities?

Comparing a version of the archive of <em>Novosti Pridnestrov’ya</em> dating early October 2016 (almost two months before the vote) that I used <a title="Link a for my own research" href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/2018/04/08/non-recognition-is-the-symptom-not-the-cause/">for my own research</a>, with a list of pages still available on the website as of late May 2018 (more than 70.000 news items in total), it again appears that a number of articles were selectively removed for political purposes.

Unfortunately, due to the timing of the scrapings, the list (<a title="Link a see full list" href="https://github.com/giocomai/transnistria_media_post_election_2018/blob/master/NovostiPmrRemovedYT.csv">see full list</a>) does not include any material published after 5 October and before the vote on 11 December 2016. Yet, it still shows a clear pattern of selective removal of contents. Some of the removed articles again include strong criticism to opponents of the then president Shevchuk. However in the case of <em>Novosti Pridnestrov’ia</em> most of the removed news items actually refer to economic aspects, in particular trade of currency operated by Transnistria’s republican bank, as well as news items accusing of wrongdoings companies that belong to Transnistria’s main business group, <em>Sheriff</em>. <em>Sheriff</em>’s backing of Krasnoselski, and more broadly open contrasts between then-president Shevchuk and the business interests of <em>Sheriff</em> have been a core part of the electoral campaign. It should also be mentioned that activities of the Transnistria’s republican bank in 2016 are currently at the centre of judicial inquiries in Transnistria, and that under the previous government debates on the monetary policy of Transnistria often pitched central authorities against the interests of the <em>Sheriff</em> holding and private banks related to them.
<h3>If the news were removed, what happened to journalists who made them?</h3>
As is frequently the case for news agencies, <em>Novosti Pridnestrov’ia</em> does not make reference to the authors of the materials it publishes. On the contrary, the website of TV channel <em>Pervy Pridnestrovski</em> often publishes the name of the journalists along with the relevant news clip. Considering the high frequency of publications (<em>Pervy Pridnestrovski</em> published more than 4.500 news items on its website, and more than 6.000 videos on YouTube in 2017 alone), the removal of about two dozens items does not preclude the possibility of analysing the trajectory of individual journalists, in particular those that routinely appeared on TV.

In order to approach this question, I parsed the almost 20.000 pages currently available on website of the <em>Pervy Pridnestrovski</em> TV channel and extracted the name of the author of each news segment currently available on the website of the TV station. Before digging into the details, here are some descriptive statistics to provide some context.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/authorAvailablePP.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74684163" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/authorAvailablePP-1024x512.png" alt="" width="980" height="490" /></a>

An increasing share of news items published on the website of <em>Pervy Pridnestrovski</em> includes reference to the reporters authoring the feature.

How many journalists are credited with articles, and how many of them publish regularly? In the following graphs, “regular” contributors are identified as those who authored on average at least one item of news per week in any given year.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/regularContributorsPP.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74684164" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/regularContributorsPP-1024x512.png" alt="" width="980" height="490" /></a>

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/articlesByRegular_PP.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74684165" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/articlesByRegular_PP-1024x512.png" alt="" width="980" height="490" /></a>

Regular contributors are behind the vast majority of news items for which the author is credited in each of the last five years. The question is, are they the same journalists? Did the December 2016 presidential election lead to an unexpected number of dismissals?

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/regularLeavePP.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74684166" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/regularLeavePP-1024x512.png" alt="" width="980" height="490" /></a>

This does not seem to be the case for either occasional or regular contributors. Only two of the ten reporters regularly appearing on the screens of <em>Pervy Pridnestrovski</em> in 2016 left their job at the end of the year, which is in line with the correspondent figure for previous years.

Including also occasional contributors (anyone who has been credited with at least one news story) as well as incomplete data for the first five months of 2018, the number of journalists who left after the December 2016 presidential vote seems in line with figures for the previous years (also considering the fact that the total number of journalists has increased.)

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/allLeave_PP.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74684167" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/allLeave_PP-1024x512.png" alt="" width="980" height="490" /></a>
<h3>But still… why did they leave?</h3>
There is good reason to believe that those two who left at the end of 2016, did so because of the outcome of the election. Indeed, both of them left the TV station immediately after the vote.

One of them was senior editor of the information and political news section. Before the election, he wrote articles that questioned the independence of Krasnoselski (some are still available on-line). His last features were broadcast and posted on-line on 11 December, the very day of the election. The other left the company two weeks after the vote; he was also working on political and economic aspects and he also had contributed to materials questioning the motivations of the <em>Sheriff</em> holding.

They seem to be the authors of the most explicit news items that have later been removed from the website. Yet, other removed items were credited to journalists that have continued working for <em>Pervy Pridnestrovski</em>.

<a href="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/leftIn2017.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-74684168" src="https://giorgiocomai.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/leftIn2017-1024x512.png" alt="" width="980" height="490" /></a>
<h3>Not so special?</h3>
These data present a story that is not particularly surprising, and can be summarised as follows. A new president comes to power through a competitive election in a non-democratic context. State-owned media staunchly but unsuccessfully supported the incumbent; after the election, the top management and a few journalists who focused on political reporting are dismissed or leave their job voluntarily. Most journalists keep their place and adapt to the new circumstances. The new management goes through the on-line archives, finds some materials that are in stark contrast with the narrative proposed by the new political leadership, and decides to remove them. These pieces do not include any particularly incriminating detail, they seem unlikely to attract meaningful attention (who reads old news anyway?), and all those interested would be familiar with the context in which they have been published. Yet somebody must have thought that simply because they are in contrast with the currently acceptable political narrative, they do not deserve the legitimacy of being hosted on the official website of a news media owned by the government.

Nothing in this story sounds particularly surprising, yet it is a story worth reporting as similar dynamics may often go undocumented: in the Internet age, how frequent is retrospective, selective censorship after changes of political regime or changes in media ownership?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Una grande manifestazione antigovernativa della diaspora romena con 100.000 partecipanti si è conclusa con 450 feriti. Si prepara un’inchiesta sull’immotivata violenza delle forze di polizia. La testimonianza da Bucarest di Giorgio Comai</em><!--more-->

Per mesi si è organizzata principalmente su Facebook una grande manifestazione della diaspora romena che vive e lavora lontano dal proprio paese d’origine. Un’azione di protesta contro il governo guidato dal PSD, contro la corruzione, ma forse in primo luogo per dimostrare che molti di coloro che hanno lasciato il paese continuano ad interessarsi a cosa succede in Romania e sono pronti ad impegnarsi perché la Romania diventi un paese migliore.

La data fissata era il 10 agosto. In migliaia sono venuti da tutta Europa, con spirito di lotta ma anche di festa per quello che era simbolicamente percepito come un momento di unione tra chi ha abbandonato il paese e chi negli ultimi anni è rimasto e ha continuato a protestare in Romania conteo l’introduzione di misure mirate a ostacolare la lotta anti-corruzione e a riabilitare figure di spicco del partito di governo PSD. Lo stesso leader del partito di governo Liviu Dragnea, infatti, non ho potuto assumere l’incarico di primo ministro nel 2016 in seguito a una precedente condanna per frode elettorale e lo scorso giugno ha ricevuto una nuova condanna per abuso d’ufficio. Nonostante le condanne, Dragnea rimane presidente della Camera dei deputati e controlla strettamente il proprio partito e il governo stesso. Dal 2016 ad oggi, Dragnea <a href="https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Romania/Romania-Viorica-Dancila-terza-premier-in-un-anno-185414">ha fatto dimettere due primi ministri del proprio partito</a> per imporre la sua autorità esclusiva sull’azione di governo; l’attuale primo ministro Viorica Dăncilă è quindi perfettamente conscia di poter mantenere la propria posizione solo in cambio di mantenere un basso profilo e dimostrare fedeltà assoluta allo stesso Dragnea. <a href="https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Romania/Romania-la-battaglia-sul-codice-penale-188813">Lo scorso 28 giugno</a>, in una rara e netta presa di posizione, dodici ambasciate (inclusi Stati Uniti, Germania, e altri governi UE) hanno ufficialmente espresso la propria contrarietà alle recenti riforme al codice penale proposte dal governo a guida PSD e la loro preoccupazione per l’impatto che potrebbero avere sullo stato di diritto in Romania, ma le misure sono state comunque approvate a inizio luglio dal parlamento romeno.

Per legittimare la propria azione, il partito di governo PSD ha pianificato per lo scorso 9 giugno una grande manifestazione pro-governativa, trasformata in seguito in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/world/europe/romania-corruption-prosecutors.html">azione di protesta</a> contro “gli abusi del sistema di giustizia” e lo “stato parallelo”, ovvero parti dello struttura dello stato (tra cui presidenza, agenzia anti-corruzione, e giustizia più in generale) che agirebbero per bloccare l’azione di un governo democraticamente eletto.

L’azione di protesta della diaspora dello scorso 10 agosto era quindi un nuovo momento di una <a href="https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Romania/La-Romania-la-piazza-e-la-giustizia-183829">lunga stagione di proteste in Romania</a>, e un’occasione per chi si oppone all’attuale governo di riprendersi simbolicamente Piazza Vittoria, l’ampio spazio di fronte al palazzo del governo dove si era tenuta anche l’azione pro-PSD di giugno.
<h2 id="una-protesta-dal-valore-simbolico">Una protesta dal valore simbolico</h2>
Attraverso gruppi Facebook, migliaia di rappresentanti della diaspora romena si sono organizzati per raggiungere Bucarest. Attivisti in varie città romene si sono organizzati per dare il benvenuto a colonne d’auto di manifestanti provenienti da varie parti d’Europa per evidenziare simbolicamente questo momento di riunione con la diaspora. Il clima era quindi non solo di protesta, ma anche di festa per un evento in ampia parte simbolico: mancando un gruppo di organizzatori definito e un obiettivo preciso, le richieste che emergevano dai partecipanti erano le più diverse, seppur unite dal minimo comun denominatore dell’opposizione al governo a guida PSD e del contrasto alla corruzione.

Fonti di informazione pro-PSD, ed in particolare il canale televisivo <em>Antena 3</em>, hanno però lavorato nelle ultime settimane per creare un clima ed aspettative ben diverse nel loro pubblico, suggerendo in continuazione che si stavano preparando violenze. Politici e commentatori pro-governativi anticipavano con insistenza scenari violenti, nonostante manifestazioni anche più ampie che hanno avuto luogo negli ultimi anni siano state ampiamente pacifiche e con pochi incidenti.
<h2 id="gas-lacrimogeni-senza-preavviso-senza-motivo">Gas lacrimogeni senza preavviso, senza motivo</h2>
Quando i primi manifestanti hanno iniziato a prendere posizione nel corso della giornata di venerdì, si sono quindi trovati di fronte schieramenti delle forze di polizia (<em>jandarmeria</em>) in tenuta anti-sommossa. Con il pretesto di contrastare un piccolo gruppo di provocatori, a metà pomeriggio quando il numero di manifestanti era ancora esiguo e la presenza delle forze di polizia massiccia, si sono subito iniziati a lanciare i primi gas lacrimogeni.

Inizialmente, pareva si trattasse di eventi isolati, e infatti la piazza ha continuato a riempirsi. Mentre le televisioni si concentravano sui primi scontri con la polizia, in gran parte della piazza vi era un’atmosfera serena, da festival, con persone di tutte le età che chiacchieravano e scandivano slogan, e <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1910128395676048&amp;set=a.814359625252936.1073741826.100000367191497&amp;type=3">numerose famiglie con bambini anche piccoli</a> nell’area erbosa antestante il museo di scienze naturali Antipa. Piazza Vittoria è molto ampia, con oltre 200 metri tra il palazzo del governo e il Museo Antipa, e quindi, circondati da manifestanti pacifici e lontani da potenziali luoghi di tensione, i manifestanti avevano tutti i motivi per sentirsi sicuri anche dopo il ripetuto impiego di gas lacrimogeni nelle zone più centrali della protesta.

Verso le otto e mezzo, una nuova ondata di gas lacrimogeni ha però raggiunto anche le aree più distanti della piazza, ben lontano da qualsiasi plausibile obiettivo diretto, ed era sufficientemente forte da causare fastidi anche nei viali a centinaia di metri da Piazza Vittoria. Con l’avanzare delle ore, la situazione è peggiorata drasticamente, fino a quando poco dopo le undici la polizia ha deciso di evacuare completamente la zona impiegando massicciamente gas, cannoni ad acqua, spray irritanti, e manganelli. Una serata inizialmente pacifica si è conclusa violentemente, con centinaia di manifestanti feriti dalla polizia o intossicati dai gas. Decine hanno avuto bisogno di cure ospedaliere, tra cui alcuni membri della polizia. Giornalisti di varie testate sono stati a loro volta <a href="http://www.cji.ro/jandarmeria-nu-are-voie-sa-se-pse-pe-legitimatia-de-jurnalist/">vittima di abusi da parte della polizia</a>, e picchiati anche dopo aver mostrato il loro tesserino da giornalisti. Il cancelliere austriaco Sebastian Kurz ha chiesto spiegazioni al governo romeno dopo che una troupe della televisione di stato austriaca <a href="https://www.romania-insider.com/austrian-cameraman-beat-riot-police-bucharest-protest/">è stata assalita senza motivo dalla polizia</a>.

L’abbondanza di immagini televisive o registrate dai partecipanti mostra chiaramente che il piccolo gruppo di persone che provocava i poliziotti già dal pomeriggio avrebbe potuto essere facilmente isolato. È evidente al contrario il comportamento provocatorio e aggressivo della polizia caratterizzato dall’insensato utilizzo di gas lacrimogeni in mezzo alla folla che ha fatto infuriare molti manifestanti e alzato la tensione. Partecipanti hanno evidenziato anche la limitata comunicazione tra poliziotti e manifestanti. La decisione finale di evacuare la piazza è stata comunicata da un segnale luminoso che quasi nessuno tra la folla è stato in grado di interpretare. Anche per questo decine migliaia di persone che protestavano pacificamente si sono ritrovate improvvisamente (e, dal loro punto di vista, inspiegabilmente) attaccate da una decisa avanzata delle forze di polizia e massicce dosi di gas lacrimogeni. Le tensioni che ne sono seguite sono degenerate in ulteriori scontri.
<h2 id="responsabilità">Responsabilità</h2>
Tutto questo era perfettamente evitabile. In occasione della maggior parte delle proteste degli ultimi anni, la <em>jandarmeria</em> romena si era dimostrata ragionevolmente competente, evitando inutili provocazioni ed evitando di sgomberare le manifestazioni. Anche per questo, e per la sostanziale assenza di una componente violenta tra i manifestanti d’opposizione, azioni di protesta che avevano anche superato i 200.000 partecipanti a Bucarest si erano regolarmente svolte senza troppi incidenti. Il comportamento della polizia diverso da quello osservato in precedenti occasioni e nettamente incompatibile con <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/pdfs/GoodPracticesForLawEnforcementForPolicingDemonstrations.pdf">buone pratiche di gestione delle proteste</a> non può che essere imputato a una conscia decisione da parte delle autorità.

Il presidente della repubblica Klaus Iohannis ha immediatamente denunciato l’eccessiva violenza della polizia, e ha reiterato la propria posizione <a href="http://www.presidency.ro/ro/media/agenda-presedintelui/mesajul-presedintelui-romaniei-domnul-klaus-iohannis-transmis-in-urma-evenimentelor-din-ultimele-zile">con un comunicato ufficiale lunedì 13 agosto</a> evidenziando che in relazione agli eventi di venerdì vi sono responsabilità giudiziarie e politiche. Dal punto di vista giudiziario, la procura ha già aperto un’inchiesta. Dal punto di vista politico, non sembra esservi alcuna intenzione da parte del governo di riconoscere che quantomeno vi siano stati degli errori. La ministra degli interni Carmen Dan ha infatti dichiarato che la gendarmeria <a href="http://www.comunicare.mai.gov.ro/stiri.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1533999429&amp;archive=">ha semplicemente applicato la legge</a>, ed ha negato di aver influenzato in alcun modo l’operato delle forze dell’ordine.

Quella di venerdì scorso è stata la manifestazione più violenta in Romania degli ultimi vent’anni. Le forze dell’ordine sono direttamente responsabili per centinaia di feriti, decine dei quali hanno avuto bisogno di assistenza ospedaliera; non solo non si è garantita la sicurezza dei manifestanti, ma sono state prese iniziative che l’hanno attivamente messa in pericolo. Un’inchiesta approfondita e indipendente in grado di individuare e punire i responsabili delle violenze non solo tra i manifestanti, ma anche a vari livelli della catena di comando della gendarmeria, costituirebbe un passo importante per recuperare la fiducia di decina di migliaia di cittadini che, protestando contro la corruzione, si sono ritrovati ad affrontare un apparato statale violento. Nelle prossime settimane, segnali di allarme potrebbero arrivare da Bruxelles (il gruppo dei Verdi al parlamento europeo è <a href="https://www.greens-efa.eu/en/article/press/romania-police-violence-against-peaceful-protestors/">già intervenuto in questo senso</a>) e, considerando che numerosi tra i manifestanti erano (anche) cittadini di altri paesi dell’UE, da varie capitali europee.

In conclusione, difficile prevedere l’impatto degli eventi di venerdì scorso sulla politica interna in Romania. Le violenze non hanno scoraggiato i manifestanti che sono nuovamente scesi in piazza in decine di migliaia anche nei giorni successivi, ma probabilmente non hanno scalfito il solido consenso elettorale del PSD (giovedì scorso, il leader del PSD Liviu Dragnea ha annunciato un <a href="https://adevarul.ro/economie/bani/promisiuni-pensii-dublate-greu-sustinut-1_5b706ed3df52022f75505966/index.html">piano per raddoppiare le pensioni</a> in Romania nei prossimi tre anni). Le indagini porteranno a nuove tensioni tra esecutivo e giudiziario, e a nuove reciproche accuse tra maggioranza di governo e presidente della repubblica. Una stagione più “brutta” di scontro politico che per il momento non sembra cambiare il quadro complessivo. Rimane comunque l’inedita testimonianza di migliaia di membri della diaspora romena che hanno dimostrato interesse a partecipare in prima persona alla vita politica del loro paese natale percorrendo grandi distanze per essere presenti in piazza a Bucarest.]]></content:encoded>
